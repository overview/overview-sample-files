REPORT DERIVED FROM USMC EOD REPORT


While RTB from previous IED (AFG-DELI-011-IED), EOD was notified from passing convoy (CAAT Blue) that there was disturbed earth and PIED on a culvert located on Redskins East. Unit on scene was able to have a southern cordonestablished and eyes on the northern and western sides of the road. EOD immediately responded.

Upon arrival, EOD made contact with OSC and was directed to where the disturbed earth was located. EOD established safe area and conducted 5/25's. EOD TL began to sweep wide west toward the edge of the canal and north to the opposite side of PIED for command wire, finding nothing at this time. EOD TL requested additional security dismounts to follow the safe path and establish security on the northern and eastern side of PIED site. EOD TL swept along a mud wall that provided cover and concealment from possible observation and cleared a path to the northern side of PIED where a 4' wall gave EOD TL a good vantage point to see PIED. EOD TL immediately noticed a bundle of copper colored command wire next to a 1.5' X 1.5' square hole in the center of the road, just east of the culvert. EOD TL also noticed a yellow jug that was placed under the culvert in the water. EOD TL quickly moved back and took cover, at the same time, EOD TL was notified by CAAT Blue that SCAN EAGLE observed a individual on the east side of the canal lying in the field. Right next to the field, where the individual was lying CAAT Blue said there was a motorcycle parked, and at the base of the canal were a pair of sandals. EOD TL requested permission to have security fire a warning shot at the canal berm in order to have the individual stand and be apprehended, because no interpreter was available at this time. Due to lack of communications EOD TL continued with exploitation of IED. Ground troops were dispatched to cross the canal and find the individual. EOD team moved back to IED site, and EOD TL moved forward with HAL kit and remotely separated the bundle of command wire. EOD TL then attempted to drag the site remotely with no results. At this time dismounted troops on the west side of canal said that the individual on the ground had crawled out and avoided detention. EOD TL at this time dropped all gear except gloves, helmet and eye pro, and climbed down into the residential irrigation canal and moved through the water to the culvert. During this time, EOD TL had complete cover and concealment from all directions. EOD TL then approached the culvert and proceeded to pull himself into the culvert to tie a line to the jug as there was no remote way of moving the jug without detection. TL returned to TM and EOD team pulled the jug from a distance of 75-100 meters while taking cover around the corner of local building. Remote move was successful and TL was able to clearly see that the jug had been separated from command wire. TL then utilized the MiniMD to cross the 4' wall and search for any other hazards. TL discovered (2) sets of wire heading strait into the ground and TL then put a 1 block TNT excavation charge to clear the site. Upon detonation, TL returned to site, and found a second jug of HME, and noticed that the cap wires leading to this jug were separated from previous excavation charge. TL placed a second excavation charge to break up the hard packed dirt. The jug was then remotely moved with a MRAP after several unsuccessful attempts were made remotely. Upon clearing the site of any additional explosive hazards, TL continued to sweep for an initiator when dismounted security on the ground brought to  L's attention a possible ant trail. TL confirmed ant trail discovering command wire running from the canal at water level to the
IED site. Dismounted troops on the west side of canal also discovered that the motorcycle they seized had multiple battery pack's that were constructed for the purposes of IED power sources. Also on the motorcycle was packing tape, electrical tape, white lamp cord, and a test light. With all the evidence collected, EOD believes that the individual in the field was in fact the trigger man for the IED and was unable to complete emplacement. EOD TL cleared the scene of any additional hazards and the unit on scene was briefed. HME was disposed of and EOD RTB. All individuals were wearing proper PPE and utilized ECM. (2) ~50lb jug of HME was disposed of by detonation on scene on the edge of the canal in order to mitigate damage to the local area.

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: AAF are continuing to target A/C, armed or not, across AO Mountain Warrior.  Within the last 72 hours there have been 11 flights engaged by AAF in AO Mountain Warrior.  Four of these occurred on 15 July 09 during an attack against a CF dismounted patrol across the river from Matin Village near the Shuryak Valley.  SIGINT intercepted after this engagement indicated separate C2 elements had coordinated their actions to increase the lethality of the attack in the Watapor Valley.  Prior to that attack AAF cells had rarely conducted sustained attacks in the Pech Valley in the face of R/W and F/W CAS support.  So far there have been five reported SAFIRE incidents during the 17 July 09 attack in the Watapor Valley, which has lasted over eight hours.  HUMINT reporting for the last seven days has identified foreign fighters and resupply of weapons and ammunition moving into the Shigal and Watapor Valleys.  The presence of these fighters as well as the sustained engagement on 15 July 09 may account for the sustained engagement today.  Based on the reports from the crew, damage to the aircraft, and recovered rounds, it is clear SWT 1 was engaged by a DShK.  Based on the angle of the impact and angle of the aircraft it is likely that the system was emplaced to the east of the Watapor, level to or above the aircraft.  HUMINT reporting regularly indicates DShKs are present in the northern reaches of the Watapor Valley.  This is the first known use of this system south of Qatar Kala Village.  This move south is likely due to LN pressure following LN casualties caused by AAF during ambushes against CF convoys to Qatar Kala village in March 09.  The increase in SAFIRE events has been matched with an increase in different engagement methods and weapons systems.  Aircraft have been targeted with IDF systems on HLZs on four occasions in the last thirty days.  Aircraft have been targeted offensively in flight (separate from ground engagements) on three occasions in the last four days.  Aircraft continue to be targeted when conducting CCAs.  This increase indicates AAF are seeking out engagements to down an aircraft to achieve a significant IO victory and gain operational momentum.  This increase also indicates AAF in many areas of N2KL are not deterred by the presence of attack and scout aircraft.  The highest threat areas remain the same: the Kamdesh Valley and Pech Valley.

Update:  Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report.  (See attached) Summary from Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At 011530D*Jul 09, an ANP patrol was notified that a worker, digging a drainage ditch, found a wire near a culvert. The ANP investigated and found a CWIED under a culvert at GR 41R QQ 511505 99292. They cordoned off the area and informed their HQ. At approx 2045D*, CIED arrived on the site. Upon arrival the ANP scene commander from MIR BAZAAR CP met with CIED and briefed them on the situation. EOD, using remote means, tried to locate and identify the IED threat but was unable due to the difficulty of accessing the IED. At approx 2145D* QRF and CIED left the site due to darkness. On 020734D*Jul 9, they returned to the site. The IED was composed of one AT Mine, TC-6, and possibly two 18L yellow plastic jugs wrapped in a bed sheet. At approx 0934D* after exhausting all other means, EOD tried to dislocate the main charge using explosive means and the IED detonated. The detonation damaged the culvert and set fire to a grass awning belonging to a local shop. The culvert is still usable by foot or by small vehicles. Once EOD confirmed that the area was clear, C-IED and QRF, using fire extinguishers, put out the fire. The awning was destroyed by the building was saved. A battle damage assessment report was sent to CNS HQ. No firing point was found. The command wire had been coiled together, probably by the ANP. ANP patrol the MIR BAZAAR road daily and many IEDs are found in that area. Due to the size of the main charge, it is suspected that the intended target was any CF or ANSF vehicles. The INS would remain at a distance, possibly behind one of the mud walls to the NORTH WEST, and when the intended target would approach, the INS would connect the wire ends to a power source. CIED concluded their exploitation and left the area at 1000D*",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,TF East JOC Watch,ANP,ANSF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RQR5110599292,32.50256729,65.67272186,TF East JOC Watch,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

EOD INCIDENT REPORT SUMMARY (SEE COMPLETE REPORT IN MEDIA)

011415D Jul 09: Alpha Co. 2nd Recon Battalion discovered an IED while conducting dismounted operations IVO 41R PQ 09960 69630. The unit discovered a subsurface IED while clearing north along RTE 605. EOD was contacted while at FOB Fiddler's Green and was able to respond to the suspected device. EOD located and confirmed the pressure plate IED and disposed of all explosive hazards. All remaining evidence was recovered and transported back to FOB Fiddler's Green for exploitation.
EOD linked up with the OSC and was informed of two areas that had strong metallic hits. EOD investigated the first area with NSTR. The next area was interrogated using the robot with positive results. A power source was found and the wires leading from it were disconnected. ATL used Talon to sweep for secondary devices with NSTR. TL then swept the area for secondary devices with NSTR. The pressure plate and the main charge were uncovered and the main charge was blown-in-place. A pressure strip wrapped in rubber tubing, approx. 9' of wires
that lead from power source to the pressure plate and main charge, and power source which
consisted of 6 D cell batteries wrapped in plastic and rubber tubing.

*****EOD REPORT AS FOLLOWS*********

Description of Incident: 021218D Jul 09: RCP-3 while traveling from FOB Fiddler's
Green to FOB Jaker to assist in vehicle recovery operations spotted a power source with
wires attached to it. It had been placed off the main road and was approx 6' in front of
a 7-ton with a mine roller. EOD interrogated the item and found a pressure plate with a
107 mm rocket attached and primed into the nose well. EOD rendered safe the device and
destroyed all explosive components. Remaining evidence was gathered and documented for
further exploitation.

EOD Procedures Performed: EOD deployed MTRS Talon and removed the power source from
the initiator. The buffalo was used to remote move the ordnance item from its original
emplacement. A secondary search was conducted remotely by the ATL using the robot and
then by the TL with metal detector with NSTR. The 107mm rocket was disposed of by
detonation.

Final Disposition: A pressure plate wrapped in black rubber, attached to a 107mm
rocket also wrapped in black rubber. Powers source consisted of 6 C-cell batteries taped
together in plastic wrapping.

Conclusion: The road had been torn up forcing a bypass along side that the locals had
been using. Rocks had been placed as a warning indicator to the local nationals not to
use the bypass. EOD believes that CF were targeted.

Description of Incident: Bravo 2 Mobile while providing security for EOD during a PBA
(AGR-NAWA-2-003) and was informed by a passing British and ANA patrol of a suspicious
piece of rubber in the road. Bravo 2 Mobile immediately told EOD team leader who
confirmed the presence of a pressure plate.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD deployed the Talon robot to interrogate the site. The
robot removed the pressure plate from its emplacement. EOD then disrupted the circuit
and followed it to the battery. Once the battery was located it was remotely moved by
the robot. The robot then followed the wires to the middle of the ground where it was
attached to the main charge. With the circuit disrupted EOD team leader collected the
pressure plate and battery and ensure there were no explosive hazards present. Then EOD
team leader uncovered the top of the main charge and was able to get a sample of the HME
used. EOD then placed a counter charge on the main charge which initiated the main
charge. EOD was mission complete at 1000.
6. Final Disposition: The pressure plate, battery, and wires were collected for
exploitation.
7. Conclusion: EOD believes the HME jug was emplaced well before the pressure strip.
The ground above the jug, roughly 6 inches, was firmly packed and did not look disturbed.
The ground above the pressure plate was loose. EOD also believes the HME was Ammonium

Description of Incident: While in route to Kotchtay, A41 was sweeping the road with
mine detectors and received a strong metal hit and also found what appeared to be a large
piece of rubber like found on previous IED. EOD was embedded and responded immediately.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD linked up with sweep team and repositioned security
for EOD operations. EOD TL and TM conducted box sweep of area w/NSTR. EOD TL confirmed
the large metal hit with MMiD on the area around the rubber. EOD TL began to excavate
deeper and cut open rubber to find a large piece of metal. The item was then remotely
moved from its emplacement to reveal it to be a large container attached to thin gage
copper wire. Wire was separated remotely and item was taken to LDA for disposal.
6. Final Disposition: All items were disposed of at LDA.
7. Conclusion: EOD believes that this IED was to be used in conjunction with the
previous IED that consisted of (4) 82mm mortars. EOD believes that this IED was intended
to cause a mobility kill on the vehicle and the mortar rounds to target dismounted
troops.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,1ST CEB S2,"Omlt A41, ANA",CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ1390228748,30.98678589,64.19290924,1ST CEB S2,1ST CEB S2,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Update: CEXC Report 09/CEXC-A/1950 associated.
Background/Summary from CEXC report: 

On 02JUL09, elements from 2/3 Echo Company reported hearing an explosion to the West of COP Geiger along Route 515. Echo 2-1 dispatched to investigate. 2-1 located the site of the explosion (SOE), set a cordon, and EOD was notified.

EOD's initial assesment from the PBA was that (2) INS were emplacing an IED on Rte. 515 when it detonated, killing them both. (1) Modified plastic bottle switch and (1) bolt were recovered from SOE. The bolt was possibly placed near the pressure switch to contaminate the metal signature of the IED because (2) more were found on the motorcycle along with (4) additional pressure plates. The INS thrown to the North of the SOE sustained injuries to his back side. It appears that he was acting as a lookout. The torso of the INS thrown to the South of the SOE appears to have been on top of the IED and possibly connecting the circuit or finishing burying the IED.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
MSN: NLT 03 0300 JUL 09 TF PALEHORSE conducts combat air movement of MOUNTAIN WARRIOR 6 and staff throughout AO LETHAL for battle field circulation
T1: Conduct combat air movement of MW 6 and staff from JAF to MGN, KOP, and BLE  
P1: Allow MW 6 and staff to attend 2-12 Memorial and inspect troops and FOB and COPs
END STATE: MOUNTAIN WARRIOR 6  and staff attend 2-12 Memorial and conduct BFC and return JAF without incident
Narrative of major events: At approx 0720z on 3 July 2009, Weapon 15 and 16 (AH-64s) were escorting Flawless 74 and Flawless 77 (UH-60s) from COP Michigan to FOB Fenty (JAF).  At that time WPN 16 observed muzzle flashes and smoke rising out of trees at grid 42S XD 8404 6748, directed towards WPN 16 and Flawless 74. Weapon 15 told Weapon16 to break IOT avoid the fire.  Simultaneously Weapon 16 suppressed the area with 30mm. Following the initial engagement, neither Weapon element was able to PID personnel near the original POO, however one manmade fighting position was located at XD 8329 6544 elev 2367m. It was a rock fortified position at the base of a large rock outcropping with wood on the floor. Weapon 15 and 16 expended 350 rounds of 30mm and approx 33 rockets suppressing the original POO and this fighting position. Flawless 74 and Flawless 76 continued east, exiting the Pech Valley.  Weapon 16 conducted a BHO with Hawg 55 (A-10) minutes after departing the Pech Valley, Hawg 55 identified 3 personnel moving down the mountain from the grid of the fighting position, but could not engage due to break of PID. Weapon 15 and 16 continued mission to JAF IOT link back up with Flawless elements.
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: Kinetic activity in the Pech Valley has increased over the last 14 days IVO COP Able Main.  COP Able Main has received SAF and IDF five of the last 14 days compared to one IDF in the 14 days prior.  It is likely that AAF had conducted VISOBS of the UH-60s and AH-64s heading west in the Pech Valley. AAF likely moved to the fighting positions to engage the 2x UH-60s as high payoff targets while returning east out of the valley.  The weapon used to engage the AH-64s is likely a DSHK due its relative prevalence (compared to other HMGs) in Konar Province, and a lack of reports regarding any other AA weapon in the area.  Based on the pilots description of the HMG location, this system was likely suspended from a tree to provide stabilization and natural concealment.  This technique was previously used in the Chowkay Valley to fire a DSHK system against COP Seray. The last engagement with a reported DSHK near the Shuryak Valley was on 30 May 09 IVO COP Able Main as two AH-64s responded to a ground convoy in contact.  Upon post flight inspection following the 30 May 09 engagement, battle damage from DSHK and small arms fire was reported.

Friendly Mission:
TF Lift(-) conducts Tag Ab Area R&S NLT 030900ZJUL09 ISO TF Korrigan/TF Warrior CIED operations.
Narrative of Major Events: BAF HUNTER TEAM I (SWT) departed BAF at approximately 0930Z.  While en route to Tag Ab valley, Spike 6 reported taking fire at 42S WD 5900 6050.  Once SWT arrived on station, Spike 6 was no longer taking fire, but reported the POO for the SAF as an area approximately 200m to the SE.  While SWT conducted recon of that area, AAF engaged trail aircraft with 3xrounds of RPG fire at 42S WD 5865 5858, approximately 1.2km N of FB KUT.  The crew felt the concussion of the first two rounds and observed the third round.  All rounds passed within 150m-200m of the aircraft.   The POO for all three rounds was identified by the crew as a grove on the western side of MSR Vermont, approximately 200m offset from the road.  SWT was unable to return fire due to ANA dismounts running into the grove immediately following the SAFIRE engagement.  As AAF in the grove engaged the SWT, Spike 6 also began receiving small arms fire at 42S WD 586 584 along MSR Vermont.  ANA searched the that POO area with nothing to report.  All friendly patrols retrograded to MSR Vermont and returned to FB KUT without further incident.
TF EAGLE LIFT S2 ASSESSMENT: This is the sixth SAFIRE event to occur in the Tag Ab/Alasai valley area in the last 30 days.  Following the trends of SAFIRE engagements in this area, FD 50 was engaged as an offensive target of opportunity while responding to a ground engagement.  AAF had good cover and concealment in the grove.  Based upon the fact that the convoy and dismounts were not engaged with RPG fire, AAF likely saved their RPG rounds in order to engage responding aircraft.  This shows that the AAF in Tag Ab are patient and understand CF TTPs.  The accuracy of surface to air engagements has increased proportionally with the volume of engagements in Kapisa.  Expect RPG and MG SAFIRE events to continue in Tag Ab and Alasai particularly during ground engagements.

tied off to a tree. EOD, using MMiDs, followed command wire along the ditch until it
came to an access road that connected to RTE Cowboys. EOD continued to follow wire east
along the access road until the wire turned south along RTE Cowboys. EOD followed wire
100m south along the route until the patrol commander insisted that operations stop and
RTB due to darkness and use of white light was not practical. Operations were to resume
the following morning. The area had constant over watch due to the proximity to

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: Out Break 70/73 provides air support to Able co 3-509th INF IVO Zerok COP. 
Narrative of Major Events: Zerok had initial contact with IDF, 107mm,  and SAF originating from north of Zerok COP at 0102Z. Reported rounds impacted TOC at 0112Z and knocked out Ables communications. 3 Geronimo drops a CCA request at 0113Z. Able reports IDF impacted their Mortar Pit while they were setting conditions for a Counter Fire Mission.  Able reports 5 x Urgent Surgical patients. Out Break checks in at 0127Z.  AWT were directed towards a small building 50 meters southeast of Zerok where a SAF cell was embedded. AWT conducted 2 x gun runs and did not observe any movement afterwards. Thereafter,  Able did not receive any further fire from that direction. AWT proceeded north along the ridgelines where the IDF originated from. AWT fired PD Rockets IVO the POO sites and scanned the area for fleeing AAF. At approximately 0205Z, while AWT scanned the ridgelines, the team received SAF. Able reported DShKa fire but could not confirm. The lead A/C had 1 x 7.62 impact the A/C and the trail A/C had 5 x unspecified rounds impact the fuselage. None of the Pilots suffered any injuries and both A/C remained mission capable. As AWT searched for the SAFIRE POO, Zerok started taking IDF again. AWT continued to scan the area and engage the POO sites with 30mm resulting in unknown AAF WIA/KIA. At 0220Z AWT secured the LZ for the MEDEVAC. Reaper reported fleeing AAF heading towards a small building along the ridgelines northeast of Zerok. AWT engaged the building with approximately 80 x 30mm and 10 x PD with no BDA. Hawg also dropped a GBU-12 on the building. AWT continued scanning the ridges searching for AAF and engaging POO sites. AWT conducted a battle hand over with Mexican 27/22 at 0400Z and returned to Sharana to refuel. AWT shut down at SAL at 0446Z with NFTR. 
TF ATTACK S2 Assessment:  AAF actions during the attack on Zerok COP have confirmed recent reporting regarding Mullah Sangeens desire to conduct a spectacular attack against the COP. There have been three previous SAFIREs within 10 nm of this attack in the past 90 days; two involving contract aircraft and one involving CF aircraft.  Two of the SAFIREs in this area resulted in aircraft being hit.  The most recent attack involved aircraft being hit with  7.62mm armor-piercing rounds.  Apaches were engaged as a defensive target of opportunity as they searched for targets and engaged the enemy.

***CAT CHANGE: INSURGENT ATTACK--> OFFENSIVE ENGAGEMENT
TITLE CHANGE: IDF---> DF/IDF

UPDATE 1307D* 
FF identified a known INS C2 node. The node had been previously indentified during Op EASTERN RESOLVE. SIGINT had been receiving multiple transmissions throughout the day from an INS Comd directing forces to attack FF in the Now Zad area. FF requested HIMARS and engaged the compound of interest. FF had visbility of the target and confirmed that no POL had been seen in the area for some time. 8 minutes prior to the strike, a call was made from the compound directing an attack against a FF convoy, hence confirming the PID. The target was prosecuted and the convoy passed safely, without incident. BDA will not be carried out by ground C/S due to the tactical situation on the ground. PREDATOR and HARRIER assets are going to conduct a BDA using FMV. Higher command was aware, the engagement was compliant with ROE (both the TFL and the LEGAD were in attendance during the palling of the strike. 

BDAR received at 2139D* 
The engagement was compliant with ROE, higher HQ was aware and BDA was conducted by USMC HARRIERS. FF were on imminent danger. FF engaged at GR 41SPR 3980987198. Terrain was light urban. None CIV were PID IVO target area. Target was compound. Building was destroyed. Battle damage will be recorded with FMV and HARRIERS. 
FF assessed that INS COMND was directing INS forces through that area and target building. BDA: 7 x INS killed, 3 x ISAF WIA USA CAT C, 1 x vehicle (MVTR) MK.

night, EOD along with A41 conducted sweep of RTE Cowboys in vicinity of the command wire
found the previous day. While conducting the sweep, a British soldier discovered a thin
gage copper wire running west to east through a small field. EOD TL was co-located and
began EOD operations.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD set up security around the site and began to follow the
thin gage copper wire using a MMiD. EOD TL swept the wire 30m until it turned south
along RTE Cowboys. EOD TL swept the immediate area on the route and received a large
metal hit on the right side of the road. EOD TL began to excavate the area and uncovered
a large pressure plate wrapped in clear plastic. EOD TL remotely moved the pressure plate
from emplacement separating it from two sets of plastic coated wire. Upon investigation
of the wire, EOD TL discovered that the wire was the wire found the night before. EOD TL
continued to sweep the area and received another strong metal hit in the middle of the
road. EOD TL excavated area to discover a large plastic jug filled with ANAL. EOD TL
remotely moved the jug from its emplacement.
6. Final Disposition: Pressure plate was collected for evidence and jug was disposed of
by detonation.
7. Conclusion: EOD believes that the wire found the night before was used to arm the
pressure plate IED because of the absence of a power source directly on the IED. The
copper wire found in the vicinity of the IED was not part of the IED and continued to run
south down RTE Cowboys.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,1ST CEB S2,OMIT A41,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ1229027340,30.97423935,64.1758728,1ST CEB S2,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: Outbreak 04/11 provides air support and resupply escort to Able Co 3-509th INF IVO Zerok COP.
Narrative of Major Events: At 0415Z the AWT observed 2 x RPG air bursts between the CH and the AH while escorting the resupply mission to Zerok COP. The aircraft observed two smoke trails to the right side of the trail CH-47. The AWT conducted reconnaissance and assessed the angle  and direction of the smoke trail to determined the POO site to be an open field at 42S WB 2407 6177. The AWT fired 10rds into the field to suppress the AAF.  The aircraft did not see any movement or personnel in the area. The aircraft continued their mission to Zerok.
TF ATTACK S2 Assessment:  AAF actions during the attack on Zerok COP have confirmed recent reporting regarding Mullah Sangeens desire to conduct a spectacular attack against the COP. There have been three previous SAFIREs within 10 nm of this attack in the past 90 days; two involving contract aircraft and one involving CF aircraft. This is the second SAFIRE IVO Zerok COP within the last 12 hours. The attack occurred in the established no-fly zone, which requires an AH escort to traverse.  This area retains its status as the highest threat area to aircraft in P2K.

Blackfoot 2 after securing Battalion Objective Gulf moved to a intersection to provide support for the rest of Bravo Company. 2nd LT Conner has received reports of the road by the intersection being mined. There was a line of rocks placed across both sides of the roadway to ensure that civilians knew of the ""mines."" Once security was set attached engineers started a sweep of the roadway to look for mines and IED's. Cpl Martians, attached to 1/5 from 2nd CEB, was manning the CMD and received a strong metallic hit (5 Flashing lights). Cpl Martians also noticed the ground looked soft over the metallic hit and informed the embedded EOD team.

EOD deployed the Talon robot to interrogate the site. The robot removed the battery pack from the circuit. With the battery pack removed the pressure plate was uncovered and removed. EOD then used a clearance charge to uncover the main charge of the IED. After the main charge was uncovered the EOD team leader was able to remove the improvised blasting cap, and recover a sample of the UBE. EOD initiated a burn on the jug to destroy all of the UBE. After all UBE was destroyed engineers filled in the hole and continued the sweep. EOD was mission complete at 1500.

The pressure plate, and battery were collected for exploitation.

END STATE:  AAF activity in Dangam, Marawara, and Dara Noor Distircts is disrupted and  CF FOM is enhanced
Narrative of major events: 0905 : Depart JAF. 0939: Arrived on station at FOB Blessing, talking to Gator 91. They had received IDF and had us check a possible POO at XD 7750 7604.  0949: We conducted reconnaissance in the area and identified several fighting positions to the high ground to the east of several abandoned or semi-transient villages. Additionally we observed several caves. We identified two fighting positions vic POO at XD 7763 7620 and XD 7722 7602, with the latter having something visible inside the cave. We conducted several passes to obtain photos and observe further. 1035: Gator 91 cleared us to engage the fighting positions after confirming no civilians were in the area, with the initials of KH. We conducted two engagements, expending 150 rounds of .50 cal and several rockets. 1041: We then conducted two engagements on XD 7763 7620. As the trail aircraft was on the inbound run conducting a rocket engagement, they observed a man emerge from the previous target at XD 7722 7602 and fire at least one round towards the aircraft. They broke left and the lead aircraft suppressed with 100 rounds of .50 cal and several more rockets. We observed no further movement or activity in that area. 1100: Hawg 57 was on station observing the position and we broke station for refuel
1140: Pushed west towards Blessing. As we arrived they received two IDF rounds south of the FOB. We observed a plume of smoke and dust just prior vic XD 7066 7250 and conducted reconnaissance of this ridgeline for evidence of movement or scorched earth. Observed a number of caves, as well as excellent overwatch of Blessing. Was cleared by Gator 91 to engage the ridgeline and caves with the initials KH. 
1200: Engaged with 100 rounds of .50 cal and 6 rockets. Continued to conduct reconnaissance of the ridgeline. Hawg 57/58 were on station and observed the ridgeline, passing hot spots at XD 7088 7244 and XD 7020 7198. Observed no movement in the area. 1244: Conducted refuel at FOB Blessing. 1320: Hawg and two F-15s to drop 2xGBUs on the POO. We observed from the east and Weapon moved east vic COP Michigan. 1320: Dude dropped 2xGBU. 1325: Weapon resumed aviation coverage and we departed to the east. 1350: Conducted area reconnaissance vic historic fighting positions in the southern Watapur Valley. 1440: ARR JAF. EOM. 
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: FOB Blessing has received IDF originating from the areas to the north and east for 5 out of the last 6 days. HUMINT has continued to state AAF desire to  continue IDF attacks and are planning a ground assault on the FOB. HUMINT reports have indicated that AAF plan to split into two groups.  One element coming from the west IVO Weradish Village and the other from the north IVO Walo Tanga Village.  Ground forces have observed LNs leaving the area and not coming outside of their houses.  This could indicate an imminent attack is about to happen or this could be a reaction to the constant IDF attacks.  IDF attack are expected to continue on FOB Blessing in the next few days and it is likely that AAF are conducting the attacks to prepare for a coordinated DFA.  AAF are likely to use SAF and RPG during this possible DFA.

Report Derived from USMC EOD Report - AFG-NAW-2-007 (IED)

While searching a ""mined"" road 3rd Plt received two strong metallic hits, which they had EOD check once the road was cleared (AFG-NAW-2-006 - See associated SIGACT) to the point Blackfoot 6 was located.

The EOD Team Leader disembarked the vehicle and talked to the engineers who had the metallic hit. EOD Team Leader placed a clearance charge on the first metallic hit with NSTR. Once the EOD Team Leader was shown the location of the next strong hit, there was an obvious ""ant trail"" in the dirt, and a soft spot next to it. The EOD Team Leader proceeded back to the truck to deploy the robot. The robot immediately found wires and was able to remove the pressure plate from its emplacement. The wires then led to the battery which was also removed by the robot. Once both of these were removed from the circuit and brought away from the IED, they were collected
and EOD ensured there were no explosive hazards present. A clearance charge was utilized to uncover the main charge. Once the main charge was uncovered EOD was able to remove the improvised cap, and take a sample of the HME. EOD then initiated a burn of the HME.
All explosive hazards were destroyed on site. The hole was back filled by Marines from 3rd Plt. 
EOD was mission complete at 1900.

Evidence Collected: 
(1) Pressure Plate 24"" X 3.5"" X 2.25""
(1) Motorcycle Battery
(1) Improvised Container (Plastic Jug), NEW 40lbs

The battery was collected for exploitation.

IOT conduct IED sweeps on various foot paths surrounding 3rd Plts PB. EOD embedded in the
patrol. An IED was located at GRID 41R PQ 24310 72190. There were no man portable ECMs in
the patrol. There were no injuries and no damage to ISAF equipment.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD departed friendly lines at 1700L. At 1730L attached
engineers identified a large metallic hit on a foot path over a small culvert. The hit
was over loose ground. EOD was immediately requested. EOD TL confirmed IED. EOD remotely
cleared IED. EOD was MC at 1800L. Patrol continued and located a second IED at Grid 41R

friendly lines at 2030L.
6. Final Disposition: All explosive material was destroyed on site. All IED components
were collected for further exploitation.
7. Conclusion: The IED consisted of a buried pressure plate attached to a battery pack
that was concealed behind a tree about 5 meters away and a main charge of three 82mm
mortars daisy chained with detonation cord. It is EOD assessment that the IED was
emplaced approximately 24-48 hrs prior. It is most likely that all avenues of approach to

IOT conduct IED sweeps on various foot paths surrounding 3rd Plts PB. EOD embedded in the
patrol. An IED was located at GRID 41R PQ 24694 72378. There were no man portable ECMs in
the patrol. There were no injuries and no damage to ISAF equipment.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD departed friendly lines at 1700L. At 1930L attached
engineers identified a large metallic hit over a pile of Poppy stalks staked to the right
of the foot path. EOD was immediately requested. EOD TL confirmed IED. EOD remotely
cleared IED. EOD was MC at 2015L. Patrol continued and no other IEDs were located on the
patrol. EOD entered friendly lines at 2030L.
6. Final Disposition: All explosive material was destroyed on site. All IED components
were collected for further exploitation by EOD.
7. Conclusion: The IED consisted of a buried pressure plate and battery pack attached to
a DFC facing the likely avenue of approach to buildings IVO Grid 240 723. The DFC was on
the left side of the foot path and the battery was buried in the tall grass to the right.
The pressure plate was found in loose sand in the center of the foot path. It is EOD
assessment that the IED was emplaced approximately 48-72 hrs prior. It is most likely
that all avenues of approach to Buildings IVO Grid 240 723 will have IEDs. The area was
identified as a Taliban strong hold. All personnel patrolling the vicinity of 3rd plts AO
must sweep all patches of loose sand along vehicle and foot paths with CMDs. If CMDs are
not present in the patrol no one should walk on loose ground unless moving through
farming fields.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,MEB-A / TF EAST JOC WATCH,C Co 1-5 USMC,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ2469472378,31.37926102,64.31132507,1ST CEB S2,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
TOMMY GUN 32 and TOMMY GUN 41 were supporting and protecting ANP CP at 42SVC2723429530. During approach, approximately 700m from the CP ANP TOMY GUNs was engaged by SAF from HUSAJNKHEL village.
Narrative of Major Events: TOMMY GUN 32 and TOMMY GUN 41 were supporting and protecting ANP CP at 42SVC2723429530. They departed at 1505Z. During approach, approximately 700m from the ANP CP, TOMMY GUN element were likely engaged by an AK/PKM variant weapon from the village  of HUSAJNKHEL. TOMMY GUNs  could not  identify the enemy position and made the decision to return to FOB GHAZNI.
Timeline:
051518ZJUL09 -  TIC was reported/about 80 to 120 rounds of SAF fire
051737ZJUL09  TOMMY GUN 32 and TOMMY GUN 41 returned to FOB GHAZNI
TF White Eagle Assessment: The SAF attack was an ambush for PL helicopters. The AAF fire positions were prepared earlier. An enemy tactic is to wait for helicopters, engage with SAF and escape. Their tactic seems to include hiding and taking cover in the nearby compounds. The AAF are strongly determined to shoot down PL helicopters. 0-WIA, 0-KIA
TF Thunder S2 Assessment: This SAFIRE event is assessed as MINOR/SAF.  No SAFIRE events have occurred within 10NM in the past 30 days.  This engagement was likely a defensive, target of opportunity (TOO) attack, as anticipation of aircraft responding in this area of Ghazni is not likely.  Expect further SAFIREs in this area to be assessed in a similar manner, with SAF being the primary means of attack.",RC EAST,ENEMY,,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,TF WHITE EAGLE,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SVC2723429530,33.70324707,68.21477509,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,A SIGACTS MANAGER,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

directed to the IED incident site. Once at the site the EOD TL and ATL performed a secondary sweep with NSTR. Once secondary sweep was completed evidence was collected by EOD and post blast assessment completed.

Secondary sweep was performed with metal detectors around blast seat and immediate area. Post blast assessment was performed, evidence was collected.
Fragments from plastic jugs were collected; no other evidence could be located.

There was a significant amount of large metal debris from the vehicles still scattered around the IED site making it difficult to efficiently sweep for secondary devices. There were also other items collected at the scene that could have provided vital information about our vehicles to the enemy.

of route from 41R PQ 24071 72357 to 41R PQ 23188 74088 IOT establish resupply route to A
Co position at 41R PQ 23060 74276. A PIED was locate at 41R PQ 23301 73159. EOD already
embedded was requested. EOD confirmed IED. There was vehicle ECMs in the patrol. There
were no injuries and no damage to ISAF equipment.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD departed friendly lines at 0445L with QRF. At 1130L
attached engineers identified a large metallic hit at above grid. EOD was immediately
requested. EOD TL confirmed IED. EOD remotely cleared IED. EOD was MC at 1200L. Route
sweep continued and no other IEDs were located on the patrol. EOD entered friendly lines
at 1800L.
6. Final Disposition: All explosive material was destroyed on site. All IED components
were collected for further exploitation.
7. Conclusion: The IED consisted of a pressure plate a battery pack and a DFC in the
corner of a compound wall. The battery pack was located behind the same wall the DFC was
concealed in. The battery was concealed behind a compound wall to allow the emplacer to
arm the IED from a safe position. This allows target discrimination and a well concealed
escape route. The pressure plate was constructed with a large metal contact over a wooden
base on the bottom of the pressure plate and a hacksaw blade attached to springs for the
top contact. The entire pressure plate was wrapped in a grey motorcycle cover to protect
the metal contacts. After the plate was emplaced a piece of clear plastic was placed over
the plate. Dirt and hay was used to conceal it. The angle of the pressure plate and
distance from the wall leads EOD to believe that the IED was targeting dismounts. Lose
sand around the pressure plate was an easy secondary indicator along with a difference in
the color of mud used to conceal DFC. All lose sand must be swept on vehicle and foot
paths.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,MEB-A / TF EAST JOC WATCH,1/5 USMC,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ2330173159,31.38645554,64.29677582,1ST CEB S2,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
MSN: NLT 06 0600z JUL 09 TF PALEHORSE conducts reconnaissance and security for CAVEMAN elements conducting KLE at Kam Dergi
Narrative of major events: SWT departed JAF to conduct area security for Caveman 26 IVO Kam Dhirgi 42S WD 8646 1563.  Arrived at Kam Dhirgi and provided security until 0840z when retasked to a TIC IVO 42S WC96 87 ISO Assassin 16.  While enroute to link up, SWT observed a silver Toyota pickup along a ridge to the west of Assassin 16.  SWT arrived in support of Assassin 16 at 0850z, located friendly elements who were still taking fire, and attempted to locate AAF positions. AAF fired 1 RPG at lead A/C (witnessed by left seat lead) from a grove of trees.  The SWT engaged the POO IVO 42S WC 9703 8568 with 100rd .50 cal, 2x HE, and 2x WP. Area was heavily wooded and enemy not visible, but smoke from RPG firing was visible. After A/C fired, AAF firing ceased and friendly vehicles were able to tow damaged vehicle out of the area. SWT continued to orbit the area until refuel approx 20 minutes later. When SWT departed the area, friendly convoy again took sporadic small arms fire, which continued until SWT returned. Upon SWT return enemy fire stopped and SWT provided overhead cover. At 1037z, SWT observed a group of approximately 60 people in an open field lined up to pray (see pic) with what appeared to be a body under a sheet. Ceremony lasted about 5 minutes then people moved very rapidly out of the area. The silver Toyota pickup was also spotted several times throughout coverage, however the SWT could not obtain PID of the occupants.  Also noted was a compound with two burned car hulks IVO WC 9613 8613 which looked very similar to the IED trainers seen in RC-South. SWT departed to refuel and was relieved by SWT5.
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: This is the second SAFIRE in Sherzod District. The previous incident was on 15 JUN 09 approximately one kilometer north-west of today's position. Both incidents involved convoy over-watch / support, and SAF which was concluded with RPG fire from a hidden location. Sherzod District had HUMINT reports of increased insurgent cross-border traffic from the PAKMIL operations to the south. Insurgent cells in this district seem undeterred by supporting A/C.  This area will see an increase in kinetic activity in the next few months, possibly due to  insurgents lack of contact with CF and a sense of accomplishment in these past two engagements. On the 4th of July an OH-58 had a hard landing just south of JAF as a result of maintenance issue. The Taliban is also claiming they shot down this OH-58 IOT raise the morale if their fighters.  These are most likely the reasons that AAF in this low air threat area have been engaging A/C more frequently.  A/C responding to TIC and A/C conducting reconnaissance are likely to have a higher than normal risk of SAFIRE in Southern Nangahar Province.

Team was able to locate and recover both the pressure plate and 9v battery. Due to Buffalo over confirming IED, EOD was unable to locate the main charge. EOD utilized exploratory demo charge and Buffalo (dug a 10'x8'x2' trench around pressure plate location), and was still unable to locate the main charge.

At 081235D*Jul 09, a mentored AUP patrol from DAND DC was responding to a LN call about a suspected IED on an unnamed route. The AUP arrived on scene and found a white wire running into the road. They set up their cordon and the CF mentors sent in a 10 liner. At approx 1445D*, QRF and CIED from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS) deployed and liked up with the AUP from DAND DC. They were escorted to the site and using remote means confirmed the presence of an 18L yellow plastic jug buried in the middle of the unnamed dirt road at grid 41R QQ 53462 97139. The jug was determined to be empty and did not have any power source, explosives or detonator. The white wire was buried and ran WEST for about 1M, ending in a clean cut. CIED questioned several LN that were in the area. The LN told CIED that the INS placed the IED at night two days before. The INS often patrol the area on foot at night with small arms and place IEDs. The IED (HOAX) was placed on a road that is patrolled two to three times a week by the AUP. They also had carried out several anti-narcotic operations in the area during the past months. The INS probably place the IED (HOAX) during the night and it was buried in a shallow hole in the middle of the road.

of route from 41R PQ 265 736 to 41R PQ 263 722. A PIED was locate at 41R PQ 26360 72450.
EOD already embedded was requested. EOD confirmed IED. There was vehicle ECMs in the
patrol. There were no injuries and no damage to ISAF equipment.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD departed friendly lines at 0700L with QRF. At 1415L
attached engineers identified a large metallic hit at the above grid. EOD was immediately
requested. EOD TL confirmed IED. EOD remotely cleared IED with talon robot. The main
charge was then burned in place by a thermite grenade. The decision to utilize a thermite
to burn UBE was due to the possibility that the main charge contained an anti-lift
device. If the main charge would have high ordered the road would have been made
impassable. EOD was MC at 1530L. Route sweep continued and no other IEDs were located on
the patrol. EOD entered friendly lines at 1800L.
6. Final Disposition: All explosive material was destroyed on site. All IED components
were collected for further exploitation by EOD.
7. Conclusion: The IED was consistent with IEDs in C Cos AO. It consisted of a pressure
plate, battery pack and 45 lb UBE jug. The main charge was 2 offset from the plate in
the center of the road. This configuration was the first seen in C Cos AO. It is most
likely the Taliban is aware of our HMMWVs vulnerabilities. Up to this point the pressure
plates had been placed directly over the main charge (Naw-1-003, Nawa-1-004). This IED
could have been emplaced by a different IED cell. The ground over the main charge was
harder and not consistent with the ground over the pressure plate. This leads EOD to
believe that the main charge was placed 48-72 hrs prior than the pressure plate. The
pressure plate was emplaced as recent as 24-48 hrs. There is no doubt that this IED was
targeting a mounted patrol. A small sample of UBE was attained. EOD has no mean to verify
UBE but believes that the UBE is Ammonium Nitrate based.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,MEB-A / TF EAST JOC WATCH,1-5 USMC,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ2636072450,31.37973022,64.32884979,1ST CEB S2,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

located an IED uncovered by a local IVO GRID 41R PQ 24535 72195. 3/3 immediately
established a cordon and requested EOD support. There was no man portable ECMs in the
patrol. There were no injuries and no damage to ISAF equipment.
5. EOD Procedures Performed: EOD departed friendly lines at 1050L with QRF. EOD Linked
up with a fire team from 2/3 and was escorted to 3/3s cordon. EOD was briefed by OSC
SSgt Barajas. EOD remotely cleared IED. EOD was MC at 1200L. EOD conducted secondary
sweeps with NSTR. EOD attached to 3rd Plt for the rest of the day. EOD entered friendly
lines at 2200L.
6. Final Disposition: All explosive material was destroyed on site. All IED components
were collected for further exploitation.
7. Conclusion: The IED was consistent with IEDs in C Cos AO. It consisted of a pressure
plate, battery pack and 45 lb plastic UBE jug. The main charge was offset 2.5 from the
pressure plate and buried in the middle of the path. This configuration is specifically
targeting a mounted patrol. The power source ran to the right of the path into the back
side of an embankment. This is to ensure the IED emplacer can arm the IED from a covered
position and have a concealed escape route. The path is wide enough but has not been used
for vehicles. A small sample of UBE was attained. EOD has no mean to verify UBE but
believes that the UBE is Ammonium Nitrate based. EOD can not determine when the pressure
plate was emplaced because it already had been uncovered. The consistency of the ground
over the main charge would lead EOD to believe that the main charge was placed about 5-7
days ago.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,1ST CEB S2,1/5 USMC,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ2453572195,31.37762833,64.30963135,1ST CEB S2,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

From Canadian EOD report 10-07-09 EOD3-033
-------------------------------
At 100800D*Jul 09, the QRF from FORWARD OPERATON BASE MASUM GHAR (FMG) was deployed to investigate an IED site on Rte BROWN at GR 41R QQ 29635 88286. A CF route clearance package (RCP) was conducting a clearance to PATROL BASE SPERWAN GHAR (PBSG). As they dismounted to conduct a VPS on a culvert, an IED detonated on the WEST side of the road at approx 25m from them. They returned to their vehicles and kept eyes on the site until CIED arrive. CIED arrived on site at 0837D* and began exploitation. While exploiting the site, EOD discovered a DTMF. The IED was placed to target the CF. It was probably meant to be detonated once a vehicle would have crossed the culvert. The INS saw the CF conducting the VPS and detonated his device. A compound located to the WEST would had been an excellent area to have a firing point as it offered concealment as well as excellent visibility to the device. CIED concluded their exploitation at 0937D* and returned to FMG.

Objective 1 to a local compound in order to make a Combat Outpost was informed by the
ANCOP of an IED on the route. EOD was sent back to where the ANCOP was located and shown
the placement of the IED.

EOD Procedures Performed: The Talon robot was deployed to interrogate the scene. The
robot was able to remove the pressure strip from the ground. The pressure strip was
disconnected from the circuit. The robot then placed a clearance charge to expose more
of the IED. After the clearance charge detonated the robot was able to find the battery.
With the battery and the pressure plate found a charge was placed on the main charge
which detonated the IED. EOD was mission complete at 1930.

Final Disposition: None.

Conclusion: The area where the IED was found was swept 20090709 and the IED was not
found. Both the pressure plate and battery would have given a big metallic hit and would
have been found. Also the area had obvious signs there was an IED there. First an ""ant
trail"" was visible from 30ft away going from the main charge, in the middle of the road,
to the battery which was off the right side of the road. The battery was camouflaged by
being buried and covered with a big rock. Also the area where the pressure plate was
loose and looked like something was buried there. The ground had not had time to settle
and look more natural.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,1ST CEB,B Co 1/5,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ2536883989,31.48392296,64.31987762,J3 ORSA,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
2 x U/I RW A/C were conducting INFIL of ground forces IVO  42S VB 48500 73750. 
Narrative of Major Events: At 1755z, RW (0ft AGL, 0 KTS, HDG 045) IVO 42S VB 48500 73750 ,while conducting INFIL operations RW-2 observed 1-2 tracer rounds pass to the right of the aircraft. Tracer color could not be determined due to NVG usage. Pilots estimated the tracers to be 7.62mm, but could not identify burn-out distance. The aircrews felt threatened and performed evasive maneuvers once the ground force was clear of the A/C. The aircrew observed 3-4 additional tracer rounds while pulling away from the HLZ. Crew members did not return fire, as they could not positively locate and identify the enemy. Estimated POO was approximately 75-100m directly behind the aircraft. Illumination was 100%, but there was significant cloud cover. No injuries to crew of damage to A/C reported. NFTR.
ISRD Assessment:  Close, minor, probable SMARMS. Assessment is based on aircrew observation and reporting. It is assessed that this was a target of opportunity engagement due to the proximity to the objective and the presence of the ground forces. There were no SAFIREs within 10NM in the past 30 days. The nearest event was approximately 14NM NW, SMARMS vs RW (no hit) occurring on 02 JUL 09. 
TF Thunder S2 Assessment: This SAFIRE event is assessed as MINOR/SAF.  No SAFIRE events have occurred within 10NM in the past 30 days.  This engagement was likely a defensive, target of opportunity (TOO) attack, as anticipation of aircraft responding in this area of Ghazni is not likely.  Expect further SAFIREs in this area to be assessed in a similar manner, with SAF being the primary method of engagement.

*** EOD POST-BLAST INCIDENT SUMMARY***  FULL REPORT - SEE MEDIA
Description of Incident: 110758 JUL 09: EOD received 9-line for 3/11 convoy traveling east on Route 605 that had struck an IED IVO 41R PQ 12367 69001. EOD AOS and linked up with the OSC and established a 360 degree cordon around the site. EOD TL then conducted a secondary sweep at which time he discovered a device approximately 100m from the blast site. Once the device was rendered safe and disposed of, TL conducted another secondary sweep to blast seat with NSTR. ATL then conducted sweep down range and EOD conducted PBA. Occupants suffered minor injuries and were wearing all required PPE.

EOD Procedures Performed: EOD AOS and linked up with OSC. TL conducted sweep around area using CEIA metal detector with NSTR. PBA was performed and noted that the vehicle struck the device along side of the road. The initiator was located on top of the main charge which was an estimated 50-60lbs of HME. No power source or initiator was located only pieces of the yellow jug containing the HME were found in and around the blast seat. A final secondary sweep was conducted by the TL and ATL around the area with NSTR.

Final Disposition: Pieces of the yellow jug containing the main charge were
collected for evidence.

*** EOD SECONDARY IED F/C***  FULL REPORT - SEE MEDIA
Description of Incident: 110845D JUL 09: 3/11 requested EOD support in response to
a vehicle struck by an IED. A possible secondary IED was discovered approx 100m south by
TL while performing a sweep of road enroute to post blast site. TL had a large metallic
hit on the side of the road and upon further investigation the IED was confirmed. A
cordon had already been established for the PBA and just needed to be adjusted in
response to this finding.

EOD Procedures Performed: EOD AOS and while enroute to link up with the OSC, TL
performed a secondary sweep and searched the side of the road starting approx. 150m from
the blast site. Approx. 100m from where the blast site was TL uncovered a pressure
device. A disruption charge was used to break the circuit and remote move the pressure
device. The main charge was located directly underneath the pressure device along with
the power source. After all items were remotely moved, evidence was collected.

Final Disposition: Item was disposed of off the side of the road and EOD continued
to sweep area for more devices with NSTR. Pieces of the pressure plate and power source
were collected for evidence.

Conclusion: Due to placement of the pressure device along the side of the road, both
dismounted CF forces and vehicles could have been targeted.

Difficulties encountered: 5 and 25 are not being conducted. Units have metal
detectors, but have not been using them to thoroughly conduct sweeps around vehicles.
Also, cordons are not being established immediately by the on scene commanders until EOD
arrives on scene and pushes the cordon out.

Recommendation: EOD has briefed unit commanders on conducting 5 and 25's around
vehicles and cordons around IED sites. Unit leaders need to establish these procedures
as SOP and provide better training for their Marines on them.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,2ND MEB Journal Clerk,3-11 USMC,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ1209269096,31.35094261,64.17845154,2ND MEB Journal Clerk,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Narrative of Major Events:  Big Guns 77/08 were conducting a border sweep from BSP2 to BSP7.  BG elements arrived at the PAKMIL checkpoint at XC 1268 0557 and turned SW.  At 0637Z, BG 77 (lead A/C) heard a small explosion and saw the A/Cs battery compartment panel pop up, remaining hinged, at XC 1200 0500.  BG 77 did not hear fire and notified BG 08 of the incident.  BG 08 observed a cloud of smoke approx. 200m behind the lead A/C.  BG 08 focused on XC 1200 0500 and observed a cloud of dust on the ground.  BG 08 remained focused on previous grid and saw 3 MAMs wearing all black run north.  BG 08 notified BG 77 he took fire from DSHK and possibly a RPG.  BG 08 told 77 to boomerang right while BG 08 turned right toward the previous grid.  Half way through the turn, BG 08s left seater heard approximately 15 rounds.  BG 08 notified BG 77 to EGRESS due to heavy fire.  Both A/C turned west and remained low.  BG 08 witnessed 4 different plumes of smoke IVO center mass XC 1060 0456.  They were approx. 700m apart (from the first to the last) and 300m away from the A/C.  BG 77 set up a possible emergency landing approach to XC 0799 0297.  However, BG 77 decided to return to SAL after assessing the A/C was capable of RTB.  BG 77/08 RTB shutdown at SAL at 0650Z.    
TF ATTACK S2 Assessment:  The second engagement corresponds with a large cache that was found by Head Hunter 6 on 22 Jan 09 at XC 1068 0495.  AAF use this site to ambush Coalition Force patrols near the border. The site provides excellent observation from it elevated terrain. AAF were likely preparing to ambush a ground convoy but decided the A/C were a higher priority target.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
Task 1: Provide air assault security IVO HLZ RATTLER
Purpose 1: Protect Coalition Force aircraft
Task 2: Conduct area reconnaissance IVO Barge Matal for possible AAF that could influence the objective or HLZ
Purpose 2: Provide early warning to the GTC of AAF IVO the objective/HLZ
Task 3: Provide area security for TF Mountain Warrior while they reinforce the village of Barge Matal
Purpose 3: Defeat AAF
Narrative of major events: On 12 July at 0030D weapon 13 and 20 departed JAF enroute to Bostick in support of air assault.  WPN arrived at Bostick at 2045Z and waited for the Chinook elements to arrive.  WPN went wheels up Bostick at approximately 2120 to Barge Matal.  WPN arrived on station and immediately began scanning the city and the LZs.  The AWT immediately observed numerous males exit buildings on the east side of the city and identified that one had an RPG.  WPN continued to observe the PAX while the first lift landed.  The first lift landed and the personnel in the city began to exfil.  Approximately 25-30 PAX exited vicinity of girls school/ANP station and with RPGs and AK 47s.  WPN continued to observe these PAX on the egress route and they began to grow in numbers.  WPN observe d that PAX reach a meeting point under a tree VIC YE 1209 5034 ELEV 6212 feet and appeared that the fighters were moving in a position to either fire on the next lift of CH-47s or gain an ambush position on the ground forces.  WPN received clearance to fire on these AAF from CHOSIN 97 at approximately 2210Z and engaged the enemy personnel under the tree.  After the first pass WPN identified 5-10 rounds of SAF tracers directed at the aircraft, originating from under the trees. WPN elements immediately engaged with 50 rnds of 30mm.  No personnel were observed exiting after this second engagement. WPN estimated total male PAX exiting area somewhere between 40-60. 
 TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: On 07 July 09  a large number of insurgent fighters attacked GIRoA forces in the Barge Matal area of northeastern Nuristan Province.  ISR efforts could not initially confirm the engagement.  Multi-source reporting indicated a large number of fighters had captured the ABP stockpiles of weapons and were distributing these amongst the fighters and local populace.  The bulk of the enemy forces were reported to be operating between the villages of Papwrok and Barge Matal, with concentrations in Badmuk and Awlagal Villages.  The personnel observed departing the city upon arrival of CF were likely the AAF contingent left overnight  in the village.  There was no intelligence indicating the fighters had an foreknowledge of an impending air assault.  ISR coverage in the 48 hours prior to the operation had identified a DShK HMG mounted on the back of a Hilux truck, but this vehicle was not spotted by any of the aircraft during the AASLT.  The fighters that engaged the AWT likely took an opportunity to engage an aircraft in the narrow valley to regain tactical momentum during the air assault.  Following the infil of over 200 CF soldiers from TF Mountain Warrior and the 2nd ANA Kandak there have been no ground engagements in the area.  These ground forces have uncovered two significant caches in the village, which may reduce the likelihood of any further engagements.  Further information and analysis will be provided following the completion of ongoing operations in Barge Matal.

Narrative of major events: At approximately 2230Z WPN was engaged with SAF VIC YE 11475 49939 from the southwest at approximately 9500 FT AGL, 800m heading 225 at 100 knots and returned fire with 100 rnds of 30 mm.  There was no further fire received from that location.  Weapon then observed 7-10 personnel moving east along the road where we had just engaged the fighters under the tree.  Weapon could not PID weapons so we did not fire.  SPAD 26 came on station and was observing PAX with large packs on their back on the west side of the valley and weapon got eyes on however could not PID weapons.

Update:  Task Force Kandahar Counter-IED Tactical Exploitation Report attached. Summary from report:  Summary: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 120430D*Jul 09, an ANSF dismounted patrol with OMLT left STRONG POINT (SP) DAND in order to conduct a route clearance patrol on Rte MOLSON ICE. The ANSF received information from a LOCAL NATIONAL (LN) earlier during the week that there was an IED on Rte MOLSON ICE. At approx 0537D* while traveling SOUTH, they discovered what they suspected was an IED on the EAST side of the roadway at GR 41R QQ 56228 97544. The ANSF set up a cordon and requested assistance from the CF. QRF with CIED assets was deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS). They arrived on site at approx 0654D* and began exploiting the site. A suspected DTMF with a motorcycle battery was found on the EAST side of the roadway with four 20L plastic pails filled with UBE were found in the middle of Rte MOLSON ICE. The suspected DTMF and the jugs were not connected together. With the quantity of explosives found on site it is assessed that the device was emplaced to target a CF vehicle. It is suspected that the main charge was emplaced previously and the INS were waiting for a CF convoy before connecting the switch to the main charge. A suspected firing point was found two hundred meter on the EAST side of the road but no evidence was found on site.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose
A/C was in support of a TIC IVO Korengal Outpost
Narrative of major events:  At 0700z WPN 16 and 13 (AH-64) entered the Korengal to support Baker 93 taking small arms fire at XD 7397 6210 just outside OP Dallas.  Baker 93 was receiving small arms fire from Laneyal Spur, Hill 1705 and Spartan Spur.  WPN elements identified four fighting positions made of wood at XD 7495 6177 elev. 4572 and engaged with 300 rounds 30mm and 8x rockets.  Two of the fighting positions sparked and one had secondary explosions and burned.  While WPN was engaging, Baker 93 took small arms fire from Hilltop 1705.  WPN 16 turned to search the hill and identified muzzle flashes coming from the crest of the hill directed at the aircraft.  WPN 16 engaged with 100 rounds 300 mm and 10 rockets.  Baker 6 cleared HOG aircraft (A-10) to drop four Mark 82 bombs, so WPN marked the target with WP rockets and HOG dropped ordinance on the crest of the ridge line.  Baker 93 stopped taking fire at that time.  The AWT returned to JAF without further incident.
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: There has been limited kinetic activity in the Southern Korengal valley for the last week. Most  attacks have been DFA engagements against dismounted patrols.  Todays  small arms fire originated from  Hill-top 1705, which has historically been an area where AAF have targeted surrounding CF OPs and patrols. Reporting indicates AAF leaders had returned to the southern Korengal Valley.  This reporting was followed with a steady rise in small scale harassing engagements.  The return of these leaders likely brought a resupply of weapons and ammunition, as well as plans for increased engagements.  Consequently, this trend of harassing engagements will likely continue through the remainder of July 09. There is currently no intelligence reporting to indicate AAF are planning a large scale engagement within the Korengal Valley this month. Based on previous engagements, A/C responding to TICs in the Korengal Valley will likely be targeted by small arms or RPG fire from the southern and eastern ridges near FOB Vimoto.  Due to the increased presence of fighters along the ridges, A/C landing at HLZs within the valley during daylight hours are at a high risk of being targeted by AAF, as either targets of opportunity or in conjunction with engagements against CF ground forces.

Friendly Mission:
TF Lift(-) provides CCA and aerial security to TF Chosin and TF Destroyer NLT 121700ZJUL09 IOT destroy enemy fighting positions IVO OP Lions Den and Barge Matal.
Narrative of Major Events: Event 1: OVER DRIVE 43/42 (AH-64s) escorted FLEX 65 (CH-47) into HLZ Rattlesnake (42S YE 12138 50615) around 2000Z.  No significant enemy activity occurred during the landing. 
Event 2: En route back to FOB Bostick for refuel, OVER DRIVE was asked to support an on-going TIC vicinity OP Lions Den. OD proceeded south and began searching for the two reported enemy firing points at 42S YD 2641 9501 and YD 2550 9440.  While attempting to locate the enemy, OD 43 took fire from 42S YD 250 940; OP Lions Den reported DShK fire at the aircraft. OD 43 returned fire with .30mm and OD 42 engaged the DShK site with .30mm and 2xHE rockets.  OD elements then broke station to FARP at FOB Bostick. During refuel OP Lions Den reported taking direct and indirect fire from the same two enemy fighting positions.  OD flight returned to action POO sites and engaged with .30mm, WP and Flechette rockets.  End of TIC.
Event 3: Once TIC closed at OP Lions Den OD returned to Bostick to FARP and  then continued mission to Barge Matal. Once on station, the GFC, Colt 95, requested OD search to the west of his position. Two fighting positions were observed as well as 1xEKIA wrapped in a black or dark color shroud.  OD continued to observe the western hills and discovered a cave system with several openings at 42S YE 1185 4950.  The GFC suspected AAF used the cave network to move fighters and equipment on the hillside and set up effective DShK firing positions on the DC.  GFC requested OD engage any cave openings observed.  LLVI passed by the GFC confirmed 5xEKIA.  GFC requested OD return and engage the cave complex with N-model Hellfire.  After engaging OD had to break station due to being BINGO on fuel, WINCHESTER on ammo, and out of flight time.  GFC reported LLVI indicated that AAF were massing under trees on the hill and were waiting for AWT to depart before engaging CF.
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: On 07 July 09 HUMINT reporting indicated a large number of insurgent fighters attacked GIRoA forces in the Barge Matal area of northeastern Nuristan Province.  ISR efforts could not initially confirm the engagement.  Multi-source reporting indicated a large number of fighters had captured the ABP stockpiles of weapons and were distributing these amongst the fighters and local populace.  The bulk of the enemy forces were reported to be operating between the villages of Papwrok and Barge Matal, with concentrations in Badmuk and Awlagal Villages.  The personnel observed departing the city upon arrival of CF were likely the AAF contingent left overnight  in the village.  There was no intelligence indicating the fighters had an foreknowledge of an impending air assault.  ISR coverage in the 48 hours prior to the operation had identified a DShK HMG mounted on the back of a Hilux truck, but this vehicle was not spotted by any of the aircraft during the AASLT.  The fighters that engaged the AWT likely took an opportunity to engage an aircraft in the narrow valley to regain tactical momentum during the air assault.  Following the infil of over 200 CF soldiers from TF Mountain Warrior and the 2nd ANA Kandak there have been no ground engagements in the area.  These ground forces have uncovered two significant caches in the village, which may reduce the likelihood of any further engagements.  Further information and analysis will be provided following the completion of ongoing operations in Barge Matal.

Update:  Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report attached.  Summary from Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 130630D* Jul 09, an ANSF patrol left POLICE SUB STATION (PSS) BELANDAY in order to conduct a route clearance patrol on rte LAKE EFFECT. At approx 0715D* while traveling NORTHEAST on rte LAKE EFFECT, they discovered what they suspected to be an IED located 1,5m on the NORTHWEST side of the roadway at GR 41R QQ 49372 92461. The ANSF requested assistance from the CF and set up a cordon while waiting for CIED to arrive. CF element from PSS BELANDAY also moved to the incident location and reinforced the ANSF cordon. Meanwhile, QRF with CIED deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS) and arrived on site at approx 1128D*. During the exploitation, a PMN with two 18L yellow plastic jugs filled with UBE were found buried on the roadway. By putting a metallic bowl over the PMN, the INS intended to use the AP mine like an AT mine. Also, with the amount of explosives found on the site it is possible that the INS were trying to target CF armored vehicle. QRF and CIED left the scene at approx 1244D* and were back to CNS at 1325D*.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
MSN: NLT 13 0230z JUL 09 TF PALEHORSE conducts area security of Mountain Warrior ground forces IVO Barge Matal ISO OPN Mountain Fire.
T1: Conduct area security for Mountain Warrior personnel IVO Barge Matal 
P2: Allow CF freedom to maneuver IOT regain control of the Barge Matal area 
P1: Allow TF MW personnel to conduct deputy meeting
END STATE: TF MOUNTAIN WARRIOR ground forces successfully regain control of Barge Matal and general populations confidence is restored in GIRoA. 
Narrative of major events: WPN 16 and 14 launched out of FOB Bostick at approx 0620Z to respond to a TIC at Barge Matal.  While travelling west in the Kamdesh Valley IVO 42S YE 2319 2209 WPN 16 was struck by one round which entered the Co-Pilot Gunners (CPG) cockpit from the left rear.  The round entered the bottom of the aircraft and lodged itself in the bottom of the CPGs seat. The aircraft was at the center of the valley, 1200 ft AGL, and 120 Kts when it was hit.  WPN 16 turned around and fired 60 rounds of 30 mm in to southern hillside while exfilling.  WPN 16 returned to JAF with no further incident.  Upon post flight inspection, the ASDAT personnel assessed the recovered round to be a 12.7mm armor piercing.  There were only minor injuries to the crew.
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: The Kamdesh Valley remains the highest threat area for aircraft within N2KL. COP Lowell has been regularly engaged six times in the last 14 days, with several complex engagements utilizing multiple firing points and multiple weapon systems (DF and IDF). There have been three previous offensive SAFIREs in this valley within the last 60 days.  The most recent of these occurred on 17 June 09 when AAF targeted the HLZ at COP Lowell with a single IDF round as a UH-60 was on the HLZ.  The other two engagements utilized RPG round fired at Lift aircraft, and both of those near COP Keating. HUMINT reporting regularly identifies intent by cells in the Kamdesh Valley to target A/C.  Reporting has also identified caches including heavy weapons systems such as DShKs and ZPUs in the central Kamdesh Valley. However, this is the first use of a HMG near COP Lowell in 2009.  Due to ongoing operations at Barge Matal there have been numerous aircraft transiting the Kamdesh District between the FARP at FOB Bostick and the objective area at Barge Matal.  This has provided AAF innumerable opportunities to observe A/C traversing the narrow Kamdesh Valley and prepare for an offensive engagement against A/C.  LLVI and HUMINT reporting suggest AAF morale has been bolstered by reports of successful engagements in Barge Matal, likely encouraging attempts against aircraft.  Aircraft should utilize alternate routes to bypass the Kamdesh Valley, particularly the area near COP Lowell, when travelling to Barge Matal.  Aircraft should also utilize evasive TTPs, leveraging altitude and airspeed when possible, to avoid a repeat engagement.

Narrative of Major Events: At approximately 0715Z during mission MM(E)07-13B, Dust Off 51 and Honcho 52 headed northbound along HWY 1 corridor en route back to BAF from Sharana.  Flight flew at 1000 AGL and 150 KIAS when both crews observed French Coalition troops traveling along HWY 1 dismount and begin pursuing 7-8 males on foot.  DO 51 went to a safe loitering distance approximately 2 miles to the west as HO 52 established an orbit and tried to contact the GFC in order to assist CF troops.  No comms could be established and while conducting a left turn, HO 52 felt the concussion of an airburst from the left side of the aircraft and the left door gunner observed a white smoke cloud at the eight oclock.  HO 52 ascended immediately and completed their turn away from the personnel on HWY 1.  HO 52 and DO 51 then continued mission back to BAF.  En route, HO 52 came up on the right side of DO 51 so that the DO 51 crew chief could identify any visible damage to HO 52 from the airburst.  No damage was observed and the flight continued back to BAF with nothing further to report.

TF Eagle Lift S2 Assessment: At 0631Z, the COP Carwile motor pool was engaged with SAF from the west, vicinity HWY 1.  Enemy in the area then moved north of COP Carwile along HWY 1 and French CF attempted to pursue them.  This SAFIRE event is a direct result of enemy in the area having a target of opportunity shot at an aircraft.  Sayed Abad district is historically a kinetic area, particularly during summer months and along the HWY 1 corridor.  AAF in Sayed Abad will continue to offensively target aircraft with RPG rounds when targets of opportunity are presented.

The remaining 2 x casualties are currently assessed to be out of site in the helicopte.It is still uncleasr how the ICAT crashed ATT. It was initially reported as a contact from INS, but this is unconfirmed and may have been mechanical failure. All tha t is definited is there was a fire on the right side af the AC causing tail rotor failure. No INS activity reported on the ground IVO the crashsite. ICOM chatter indicates INS are setting up IEDs along the reoute to the Helo crash site to prevent/hit QRF.

Update 1130D 

TFH reported an MI 26(Jingle air) helicopter with 6 contractores on board and sling loading 2 x loads  of rations and fuel was forced down approx 1 km south of FOB JACKSON at 41SPR 72620 49320. A second HELO observed what is assessed as an RPG strike on the crashed HELO. RC S actioned QRF, 2 x AH 64, UH 60, and REAPER to the site. The Incident resulted in 1 x AFGHAN CIV cas when the AC hit a compound and caught fire. Ground forces have confirmed siting 5 x bodies within 20m of the airframe and what appears to be a sixth body on board. They were unable to determine the cause of death due to the fire still ongoing. INS are reported to have attacked the site  with SAF and ICOM chatter confirmed their intent to engage the QRF / responce force helos once they arrive on scene. In addition ICOM chatter indicates INS set up IEDs along the route to the HELO crash site. 

Update 1258D
Reports are that the RPG hit the tail rotor. Ground troops report that 4 x aircrew/pax hav been recovered (VSA) to FOB JACKSON, along with the body of a LN Child found near the wreckage. The initial 1 x LN that was evac'd with burns was taken to BASTION R3 (CAT A). A recovery team (IRT) is being deployed to recover the remaining 2xpax fronm the wreckage and to investigate the scene for any further civilian casualties.

Update 1321D
Extraction team recovered the remains of the fifth body which has been taken to JACKSON. The crew compartment is still molten hot and will remain that way for 24-48hrs. The sixth body is assessed to be in the crew compartment and unreachable until the site has cooled. The cordon has been collapsed and is returning to respective PB/FOBs due to the threat of further enemy activity and strain on continuous AH. The crash was in A high IED threat area. Statements and other repotring from the incident will be collated once the ground c/s have returned, which should help clarify how the HELO crashed.

Update 1609D
All FF have extracted back to FOB JACKSON, no further actioncan be carried out today. NFTR ATT.

Update 1630D
Contractor reports that an RPG may not have caused the HELO to cras. ISAF forces will assist the contractor in recovering the flight recordings to determine the cause.

141000ZJUL09
42SWB8959192097
ISAF # 07-XXXX
Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
Air Movement Mission on approach to FOB Salerno
Narrative of Major Events: At  141000ZJUL09, TORQE89 (100FT AGL, 118 KTS, HDG 090), was struck by SMARMS while on approach to Salerno LZ
IVO N3321.862 E06957.781.  As TORQE89 passed a wadi near the runway, the crew felt an impact to the aircraft that made the rudder pedals move.  The impact was originally believed to be a bird strike.  The crew reported seeing 6 individuals standing in the wadi observing the A/C as they flew over it.  The crew did not feel threatened or maneuver and continued on with the landing.  Upon inspection, 1x quarter-sized bullet hole was discovered in the area beneath the captains left rudder pedal.  No injuries were reported.
ISRD Assessment: Hit, Significant, confirmed SMARMS. Information provided is based on aircrew reporting and a post-flight inspection.  The size of the hole found on the A/C is consistent with a SMARMS weapon caliber.  The crew did not realize they were being engaged, and did not observe anything particular concerning the attack. While it is unknown if the SMARMS fire came from the wadi, the POO would have to be very close to it, considering the A/C was at 100FT AGL and was hit from underneath. EF probably targeted TORQE89 because it was descending and on approach to land. Although similar attacks have occurred elsewhere, the Khowst region has not experienced many of these engagements. This is only the second engagement in this region in the past 30 days. The Khowst District has seen a significant increase in CF OPs due to the ongoing PR event. This engagement may have been a reactive attack in response to the increased CF presence. While not in direct support of any major operation, TORQE89 presented itself as a TOO. EF may continue to exploit the presence of low and slow A/C as they approach Khowst. EF may attempt to draw attention away from the PR event or try to prevent the resupply of CF looking for theservice member. Should sources continue to indicate the service member is in this region and CF continue to maintain their presence, an increase in TOO attacks is possible. There have been no SAFIREs w/i 10NM in the past 30 days. Closest SAFIRE was ~12NM NE. 1 x SMARMS/RPG vs RW (no hit). 
TF THUNDER S2 Assessment: Concur with ISRD assessment in that this SAFIRE event was an Offensive Significant SAF TOO engagement. There has not been any SAFIREs within 10NM in the last 30 days. The last SAFIRE (Major/RPG/SAF) in Khowst occurred on 11JUL09 and involved a TF ATTACK SWT while conducting NAI reconnaissance of Target Sets ISO Hawa Padcha, IVO BSP 7. Expect  future SAFIREs in Khowst to comprise Offensive TOO events consisting of RPG and SAF engagements.

The blast created a crater (5x3m) in the road.  QRF deployed to site and BG engineers established a bypass to the South, remediation will be completed tomorrow.  Event closed at 1725Z.

Update:  See attached TFK CIED FIRST LOOK:  IED assessed as CWIED.  
Update:  Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report summary. (See attached media.) At approx 141450, a CF convoy was traveling WEST on HIGHWAY 1 in order to provide Force Protection to a MEWT.. The CF convoy dismounted to conduct a box search at the culvert located at GR 41R QQ 17017 94155. As the engineers were conducting their VPS, the infantry section saw a suspicious man at around 340m to the SOUTH, near a compound. Once the engineers arrived in line with the culvert the soldier on the NORTH side of the road noticed a small trailer under the culvert located on the EASTERN end. At the same time, the soldier on the SOUTH side of the culvert saw a wire on the ground coming out the culvert. The two engineers suspected an IED and withdrew to their vehicle. The front vehicle moved 10m back and the convoy commander reported the incident to higher. A couple of minutes after the detonation occurred creating a gap in the road of 9m long, 3m high and 15m wide. Right after the explosion, the suspicious man exfilled to the SOUTH. The CF tried to shoot him but with no success. The CF secured the site and waited for CIED to arrive. At 141458D*Jul 09, the QRF from FORWARD OPERATON BASE MASUM GHAR (FMG) was deployed to investigate the IED incident site. The CIED arrived on site at 1617D* and began exploitation. The possible firing point was at the compound 340m SOUTH of HIGHWAY 1 at GR 41R QQ 16774 93913. While exploiting the site, EOD only discovered remains of yellow jugs. It is assessed that the INS were trying to target CF convoy. The CIED concluded their exploitation at 1745D* and returned to the FOB MSG.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,TFK / TF East JOC Watch,2R22R BG,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RQQ1701794126,31.56173325,65.28647614,TF East JOC Watch,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

REPORT DERIVED FROM USMC EOD REPORT

While on patrol Echo 3 using MiniMD got two strong metallic hits approximately 5 feet apart, directly inline with a patch of disturbed earth on the opposite side of the road. Echo 3 also noticed what appeared to be an ant trail leading between the two metallic hits. Security was set and EOD was requested for exploitation.

Upon arrival, EOD TL was directed by OSC to metallic hit. EOD TM dismounted and conducts 5/25's of safe area. TL dismounted with MiniMD and swept west approximately 150-200 meters in order to sweep for command wire, NSTR. Due to robotic failure, TL conducted manual approach, staying approximately 15 meters away and utilized HAL kit to remotely drag the ant trail 3 times prior to approaching the scene. Upon moving downrange, EOD TL, utilizes the MiniMD, and confirms the 2 metallic signatures. EOD TL gently sweeps the ant trail and exposes 2 wires running to the 2 signatures. EOD TL utilizes HAL kit to remotely separate the wire, and starts to exploit the signature on the east side of the road. EOD TL then uncovers a power source of 7 Dcell batteries and remote moves them. EOD TL moves back downrange and starts to exploit the second metallic signature that is in the center of the road. While exploiting the
signature, EOD TL discovers the wires going strait down in the ground to a hardened object. EOD TL places a 1 block TNT excavation charge and uncovers the 2' pressure plate and wires leading directly down to the container. EOD TL places a 4 bottle water charge
and clears the surface dirt away from the container, revealing a yellow jug of HME that appears to be ammonium nitrate with aluminum powder/ANAL. EOD TL makes 3 attempts to remotely move the jug with no success. HME sample is taken from a hole in the jug, and HME is disposed of by detonation. EOD TL move back down to the disturbed earth on the west side of the road, finding nothing of significance and clears the site of any additional hazards. EOD TL then conducts after action with OSC and returns to base.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,2nd MEB / J3 ORSA,2/8 Echo Co,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RPQ0848319047,30.89978027,64.13513184,J3 ORSA,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

HAVOCs convoy moved out of the kill zone to the east. HAVOC moved east 1KM and continued to take sustained fire from the XD 8189 6755 area. The SWT engaged that area and heard a long burst of PKM or RPK fire directed at our aircraft. The team immediately engaged,  went Winchester, and departed for Abad for fuel. 
0733Z- SWT2 conducted BHO with SWT3 at the Shuryak Valley and moved east to exit the Pech Valley.
 
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: The last SAFIRE in the Pech valley was on 03JUL09 when AAF engaged two AH-64s that were escorting two UH-60s east towards Asadabad.  The fighters utilized HMG fire as well as small arms fire to target the AH-64s from the ridgelines at the mouth of the Shuryak Valley.   Convoys passing the mouth of the Shuryak Valley have been engaged 7 times in the last 15 days, from both the north and south sides of the valley.  Earlier in the day, CF captured four AAF during a raid to detain several HVIs based on recent intelligence reports, none of whom are currently believed to be the HVIs originally targeted.  The ground forces conducting a raid likely drew AAF elements from safe havens in Kur Bagh Village to the northwest towards the Shuryak Valley.  Cells in the Pech Valley East of FOB Blessing have generally been reluctant to engage convoys with SWT coverage.  Attacks against ground forces were typically short lived once aircraft engagements.  The four detainees may be a contributing factor to the length and intensity of todays attack, indicating they may be important AAF figures.  Also, the presence of numerous mounted and dismounted forces stationary in an area often utilized for ambushes likely encouraged AAF to continue engagements.  The return fire against the SWTs is assessed as defensive in nature.  While not used during todays engagement, DShK HMGs have been used against ground convoys and aircraft near Matin and Tarale villages.   Based on these events and the recent SAFIRE against an AWT mentioned above, aircraft responding to TICs in the Pech Valley should be aware that AAF cells will likely target the aircraft as well as ground forces, and may even attempt a coordinated ambush to bring down an aircraft.",RC EAST,ENEMY,,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,TF PALEHORSE,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SXD8309067110,34.92995834,71.00457764,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,A SIGACTS MANAGER,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Report derived from USMC EOD Report: AFG-DLM-038 PBA

Summary: EOD arrived on scene and linked up with the OSC. EOD was briefed on the events that occurred and given the lay out of the scene. EOD conducted PBA. Conclusion: EOD's initial assessment is that the main charge consisted of approximately 10 Lbs UBE in a thin metal container. EOD did not locate any decisive evidence to indicate the type of initiator used. Based on the location of the patrol in relation to the IED when it detonated, EOD believes the IED not to be Victim Operated.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
Air Movement Mission on approach to Sharana 
Narrative of Major Events: At 141758ZJUL09, c-130 (1617 FT AGL, 150 KTS, HDG 245), IVO N3324.710 E06836.010, was on approach to Sharana when the right scanner observed a bright flash. The right scanner observed a projectile launched which traveled a straight flight path that appeared to be directed at the sound of the A/C. Projectile did not track on the A/C and did not cause a MWS Indication. No airburst was observed but the scanner did state the projectile burned out well before it reached the A/Cs altitude. The crew did not feel threatened or maneuver but did maintain altitude for the remainder of their approach. No injuries or damage reported.  
ISRD Assessment: Close, Minor, probable RPG.  Assessment is based on aircrew observations and reporting. Information provided is consistent with an RPG due to the lack of a MWS declaration, straight flight path and the lack of smoke trail.  This engagement was likely a target of opportunity due to the lack of any indicators of planning. The individual likely targeted the A/C by its sound as the A/C passed overhead. Of note, this was the second c-130 flight to pass over the point of origin in a 10 minute period perhaps giving them time to prepare for a possible opportunistic attack.  There have been no SAFIREs w/in 10NM/30 days. Nearest event is 13NM W 1 x SMARMS vs RW (no hit).  
TF THUNDER S2 Assessment: Concur with ISRD assessment in that this SAFIRE event was an Offensive Minor RPG TOO engagement. There has not been any SAFIREs within 10NM of this event in the last 30 days. The last SAFIRE (Minor/SAF) IVO Four Corners occurred on 09JUL09 and involved a CF RW while conducting INFIL of ground forces. Expect  future SAFIREs IVO Four Corners to comprise Offensive TOO events consisting of RPG and SAF engagements.

The CJSOTFA unit LNO relayed the following allegations: At 0600D* on 15 Jul, a coalition force soldier shot a civilian in the parking lot of a gas station. The civilian was driving a station wagon south on Bagram road with women, children, and other men. The civilian station wagon pulled over to allow the CF convoy to pass them headed north toward BAF. When the civilian vehicle came to a stop, the driver opened the door and stepped out, at which time the turret gunner shot him twice in the leg with an M4. Just prior to the shooting, the turret gunner reportedly waved his arm to get the attention of the driver. The Afghan civilians applied a tourniquet to the leg and rushed the victim to hospital. The Afghan civilians allege the CF did not stop to render aid. 
The convoy was described as 30 vehicles, 5 of which were tractor trailer trucks. One of which had a trailer, the other were flat beds.  Other vehicles were a mix of MRAPs and HMMWVs. They had no flags or markings to ID which unit they belonged to. Two helicopters reportedly escorted the convoy.  
Origin of the convoy and to which command the convoy belongs is currently unknown. ISAF HQ CivCAS cell will coordinate with Regional Commands to initiate an investigation.1 Wounded None(None) Local Civilian

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
MSN: NLT 15 0330z JUL 09 TF PALEHORSE conducts reconnaissance operations in Dangam, Marawara, and Dara Noor to identify and disrupt AAF activity and enhance TF CHOSIN FOM
Narrative of major events: While providing aerial escort to Flawless 73 (UH-60) conducting aerial resupply of water and MREs to Dagger 26, SWT observed UH-60 receiving  PKM and Mortar/RPG rounds while on the LZ. Flawless immediately departed the LZ.  Ground CDR, Dagger 26, communicated he was pinned down by direct enemy fire at grid XD 8131 6806.  SAF was coming from the north, east, and west of their location and they could not move off the LZ.  SWT 1 suppressed the area where Dagger 26 was taking AAF effective fire. The AAF positions were 300 to 400 meters from the HLZ.  Moving under SWT 1 suppression, Dagger 26 then started to exfil.  While exfiling they continued to receive fire from the east and west of their position.  SWT 1 continued to provide cover for Dagger 26, receiving PKM fire from the East and West also.  After moving to the South side of the Pech, the trail aircraft received RPG fire under their aircraft and PKM fire from both sides of the Shuryak Valley.  SWT 1 expended all ordnance, but continued to provide support of Dagger26 conducting approximately six passes while out of ammo in order to provide a show of force. SWT 1 conducted a BHO with the Hawg (A-10) and then proceeded to Abad to FARP.  After returning on station, SWT 1 continued to provide suppressive fire for Dagger 26, who was still pinned down while still trying to exfil.  SWT 1 then received fire from the north east and north west of the Pech Valley where Dagger 26 was exfiling towards.  SWT 1 continued to receive fire for the next 3 engagements while providing CCA support.  SWT 1 expended all ordnance again and then conducted a battle hand over with SWT 2.  After conducting FARP operations at ABAD, SWT 1 then relieved SWT 2 to rearm.  SWT 1 then returned on station and provided cover for Immortal 19 who was 500 meters to the west of Dagger 26 and was also receiving direct fire.  SWT 1 continued to conduct CCAs where AAF were engaging Dagger 26 and SWT1. SWT 1 then conducted a BHO with SWT 2. During SWT 1s return route, Able Main came under contact and SWT 1 conducted several CCA engagements IVO XD 878 698 until the contact was broken.

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: The last SAFIRE in the Pech valley was on 03JUL09 when AAF engaged two AH-64s that were escorting two UH-60s east towards Asadabad.  The fighters utilized HMG fire as well as small arms fire to target AH-64s from the ridgelines at the mouth of the Shuryak Valley.   Convoys passing the mouth of the Shuryak Valley have been engaged 7 times in the last 15 days, from both the north and south sides of the valley.  Earlier in the day, CF captured four AAF during a raid to detain several HVIs based on recent intelligence reports, none of whom are currently believed to be the HVIs originally targeted.  The ground forces conducting a raid likely drew AAF elements from safe havens in Kur Bagh Village to the northwest towards the Shuryak Valley.  Cells in the Pech Valley East of FOB Blessing have generally been reluctant to engage convoys with SWT coverage.  Attacks against ground forces were typically short lived once aircraft engagements.  The four detainees may be a contributing factor to the length and intensity of todays attack, indicating they may be important AAF figures.  Also, the presence of numerous mounted and dismounted forces stationary in an area often utilized for ambushes likely encouraged AAF to continue engagements.  The return fire against the SWTs is assessed as defensive in nature.  While not used during todays engagement, DShK HMGs have been used against ground convoys and aircraft near Matin and Tarale villages.   Based on these events and the recent SAFIRE against an AWT mentioned above, aircraft responding to TICs in the Pech Valley should be aware that AAF cells will likely target the aircraft as well as ground forces, and may even attempt a coordinated ambush to bring down an aircraft.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
To provide MED chase for MEDVAC and QRF.
Narrative of major events: Flawless 73 (UH-60) was tasked with an emergency resupply (speedball drop) in support of TF Lethal in the Pech Valley.  Flawless 73 followed a SWT to the grid in vicinity of COP Michigan to conduct the speedball drop.  At approx. 0230Z upon arrival at the grid, the SWT and Flawless 73 conducted two low speed passes to try and identify the friendly location.  Once the ground force was identified, Flawless 73 initiated an approach to heading north to a VS-17 panel at approximately 4600 MSL.  As the UH-60 was over the location of the ground troops at an OGE hover, IDF impacted approximately 50 feet in front of the aircraft.  The ground troops immediately began firing to the NE, and the UH-60 broke contact and headed SE and down the Pech Valley toward COP Michigan.  The SWT providing security observed PKM fire directed toward the UH-60.  The UH-60 held a right orbit of COP Michigan while the SWT aided the ground troops in finding and engaging the enemy.  At 0300Z after the AMC determined it was unsafe to conduct the resupply mission, Flawless 73 flew back to FOB Wright (Asadabad) where they remained until Dustoff 24 arrived to return to JAF.
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: The last SAFIRE in the Pech valley was on 03JUL09 when AAF engaged two AH-64s that were escorting two UH-60s east towards Asadabad.  The fighters utilized HMG fire as well as small arms fire to target the AH-64s from the ridgelines at the mouth of the Shuryak Valley.  Convoys passing the mouth of the Shuryak Valley have been engaged 7 times in the last 15 days, from both the north and south sides of the valley.  Today CF captured four AAF during a raid to detain several HVIs based on recent intelligence reports, none of whom are currently believed to be the HVIs originally targeted.  The ground forces conducting a raid likely drew AAF elements from safe havens in Kur Bagh Village to the northwest towards the Shuryak Valley.  The cells were likely preparing  to attack the ground force, and initiated their engagement once they identified an aircraft passing low and slow to conduct the resupply.  These cells will likely continue offensive SAFIREs against aircraft, particularly when at low altitude and airspeed.  While not used during todays engagement, DShK HMGs have been used against ground convoys and aircraft near Matin and Tarale villages.  Aircraft traversing the Pech Valley should utilize airspeed and altitude to bypass the mouths of the Shuryak Valley and Korengal Valley to reduce the likelihood of SAFIREs.",RC EAST,ENEMY,,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,TF PALEHORSE,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SXD8188069440,34.95117188,70.99184418,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,A SIGACTS MANAGER,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
TF Lift (-) provides aerial security and o/o CCA to TF Chosen and TF Destroyer  NLT 150730ZJUL09 in Kamdesh and Katagal Valleys, Nuristan.
Narrative of Major Events: OD Flight departed BAF and proceeded to Bostick for refuel.  OD Flight was informed of a TIC vic COP Lowell and proceeded direct.  OD Flight checked out suspected POO sites and did not observe any individuals.  Ground units reported that the low aircraft, OD 43, was taking AK-47 and possibly PKM fire from a position to the south of COP Lowell.  OD Flight could not observe any individuals.  OD Flight then checked out a possible POO site at YE 2005 1942 and observed to MAM at a house at that location but did not PID weapons.  OD Flight then conducted a test fire at YE 2028 2246 with no CDE.  OD was then released and continued to Barg Matal.  
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: COP Lowell has been regularly engaged six times in the last 14 days, with several complex engagements utilizing multiple firing points and multiple weapon systems (DF and IDF). Recent engagements have also utilized a B-10 recoilless rifle system against the COP.  Similar to this engagement, the majority of attacks have originated form the southern side of the Kamdesh Valley, concentrating in the Kamu Valley.  The Kamdesh Valley remains the highest threat area for aircraft within N2KL.  There have been three previous offensive SAFIREs in this valley within the last 60 days. HUMINT reporting regularly identifies intent by cells in the Kamdesh Valley to target A/C. Due to ongoing operations at Barge Matal there have been numerous aircraft transiting the Kamdesh district between the FARP at FOB Bostick and the objective area at Barge Matal.  This has provided AAF innumerable opportunities to observe A/C traversing the narrow Kamdesh Valley and prepare for an offensive engagement against A/C.  LLVI and HUMINT reporting suggest AAF morale has been bolstered by reports of successful engagements in Barge Matal, likely encouraging attempts against aircraft.  Aircraft should utilize alternate routes to bypass the Kamdesh Valley, particularly the area near COP Lowell.   Aircraft should also increase evasive TTPs, leveraging altitude and airspeed when possible, to avoid a repeat engagement.

REPORT DERIVED FROM USMC EOD REPORT:

On 151230D JUL09, while conducting a mounted patrol around the area of Khan Neshin, U.S. Marine's, 2nd LAR Delta Co. came across (1) possible IED. They immediately established a cordon and EOD support was requested. All personnel were wearing required PPE, no injuries or casualties were reported.

Upon arrival, the EOD team leader was briefed by the OSC. Due to the terrain and mission a robot could not be used. The EOD team leader then did a manual approach and performed a reconnaissance of the area with NSTR. The items were then confirmed to be, (1) Improvised Container IED. The team leader remotely moved the items utilizing the hook and line kit. The items were deemed safe by the team leader. A secondary search of the area was completed with NSTR. A charge was then placed on the items and destroyed on site. The EOD team leader then debriefed the OSC. Photographs and coordinates were taken then.

All evidence will be taken for exploitation to CEXC, Kandahar Air Field. All explosive hazards were disposed of on site.

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: The last SAFIRE in the Pech valley was on 03JUL09 when AAF engaged two AH-64s that were escorting two UH-60s east towards Asadabad.  The fighters utilized HMG fire as well as small arms fire to target the AH-64s from the ridgelines at the mouth of the Shuryak Valley.   Convoys passing the mouth of the Shuryak Valley have been engaged 7 times in the last 15 days, from both the north and south sides of the valley.  Today ground units had captured four AAF during a raid to detain several HVIs based on recent intelligence reports, none of whom are currently believed to be the HVIs originally targeted.  The ground forces conducting a raid likely drew AAF elements from safe havens in Kur Bagh Village to the northwest towards the Shuryak Valley.  Cells in the Pech Valley East of FOB Blessing have generally been reluctant to engage convoys with SWT coverage.  Attacks against ground forces were typically short lived once aircraft engagements.  The four detainees may be a contributing factor to the length and intensity of todays attack, indicating they may be important AAF figures.  Also, the presence of numerous mounted and dismounted forces stationary in an area often utilized for ambushes likely encouraged AAF to continue engagements.  The return fire against the SWTs is assessed as defensive in nature.  While not used during todays engagement, DShK HMGs have been used against ground convoys and aircraft near Matin and Tarale villages.   Based on these events and the recent SAFIRE against an AWT mentioned above, aircraft responding to TICs in the Pech Valley should be aware that AAF cells will likely target the aircraft as well as ground forces, and may even attempt a coordinated ambush to bring down an aircraft.",RC EAST,ENEMY,,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,TF PALEHORSE,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SXD8665069520,34.95102692,71.04407501,TF THUNDER SIGACTS Staff,A SIGACTS MANAGER,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

The vehicle was struck the previous day and was returning to Fiddlers Green. The recovery assets on hand were used to remove the vehicle from the blast seat and continue on to Fiddlers Green.

All personnel were wearing PPE and there were no apparent injuries.  EOD AOS and performed a secondary sweep of the area with the CEIA metal detector with NSTR. EOD then began interrogating the blast seat where multiple fragments of HME JUG were collected. EOD swept around the area again searching for evidence and secondary devices with NSTR.

Pieces of the HME jug were collected as evidence.

Due to the large amount of pressure initiation devices in the area and enemy TTP, EOD believes that the device was a victim operated pressure device.

Although EOD heard the strike they were unable to investigate at the time. The blast seat was difficult to determine due to the fact that the vehicle had been recovered and transported back to Fiddlers Green before EOD could arrive.

ISAF # 07-1449
Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
TF Lift (-) provides aerial security and o/o CCA to TF Chosen and TF Destroyer  NLT 150730ZJUL09 in Kamdesh and Katagal Valleys, Nuristan.
Narrative of Major Events: At Barge Matal the high aircraft, OD 41, did a sharp right turn and observed a solid light grey smoke trail originating from VIC 42S YE 1129 5087.  The smoke trail originated from the ground and intersected the route of flight of where the aircraft had just passed.  OD 41 did not feel any concussions but suspects that the AAF fired at least 1 RPG.  Smoke trail dissipated after approx. 5 seconds and was not in line with the wind and originated from the border of a clearing/tree line.  OD 41 was at approx. 9200MSL at the time of suspected engagement.  OD Flight did not engage due to possible CDE and was asked to leave because Chosin 6 was conducting a shura and wanted to have a non threatening posture.  OD returned to Bostick and conducted QRF until 1100z. 
TF EAGLE LIFT S2 Assessment: The smoke trail SAFIRE event in Barge Matal is assessed as some kind of un-identifed rocket.  Reporting over the past 96 hours has consistently indicated that AAF are in possession of anti-aircraft rockets and that these weapons are spread throughout the Kamdesh and Katagal areas.  The 15JUL09 is the first reported employment of such a system against aircraft.

UPDATE 200745D* 
According to a debriefing of the soldiers who were involved at the TIC on 15jul09 east of NAWABAD it seems possible that INS also used a mortar to attack ISAF forces. One soldier reported that he saw a mortar through the scope of his weapon. A number of soldiers reported several heavy explosions and furthermore explosions approximately 20 meters above the ground.

Friendly Mission:
TF Lift(-) conducts MEDEVAC mission BAF-GHZ-BAF NLT 151830ZJUL09.
Narrative of Major Events: At approximately 1850z, Dust Off PID 1 tracer directed towards the lead aircraft.  The round missed the aircraft by 300m. Crews did not feel threatened and did not maneuver. DO contacted EL TOC and passed a SPOT report.  Dust Off continued mission with NFTR.

TF Eagle Lift S2 Assessment: This SAFIRE is assessed as an offensive target of opportunity SAFIRE.  The enemy most likely engaged the sound of the aircraft.  However, the flight profile of the Dust Off flight was too high and too fast for the enemy to  effectively engage either aircraft.  There have been no SAFIREs within 10NM in the last 14 days.  The last SAFIRE event to occur in Sayed Abad was during the daylight hours of 13JUL09 when a MED CHASE aircraft was engaged with a single round of RPG fire.  The enemy in Sayed Abad will continue to engage aircraft transiting the HWY 1 corridor.  It is important that aircrews maintain an en route altitude well out of small arms range  recommend at 1000 AGL or greater.

Chief of Highway police reported about a POSS INS attack and roadblock at Ring road 5. At 0400D*, PRT MES TF (INF PLT and 2 x CV90s) left for the site with JTAC assets. Information source (AC), on the site, had claimed that approx. 50 INS were blocking the road and that 1 AC vehicle had pushed through the blockade towards SHEBERGHAN. INS opened fire with SAF and wounded 1 x AC(Cat UNK) At 0700D* TF started patrolling in the area. At 0815D* 2 x CV90s and 1 x squad came back to PRT MES camp and the rest of the TF stayed on site to conduct more patrolling.

UPDATE 1050D* 
According to the TF OiC, the information received seems to be somewhat inconsistent. Information received from ANP states that a patrol sent from a checkpoint heard shots fired from the spot where the incident took place. ANP fired in the air and as they approached the site the patrol saw people moving northwards from the spot. Patrol assesses that the number of people was approx. 50. There was also a concrete element that was put on the road. The element would have been able to stop a vehicle, but it was not blocking the whole road. All units back in camp. NFI.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
TF PALEHORSE conducts area security of Mountain Warrior ground forces IVO Barge Matal ISO OPN Mountain Fire.
T1: Conduct area security for Mountain Warrior personnel IVO Barge Matal 
P2: Allow CF freedom to maneuver IOT regain control of the Barge Matal area 
P1: Allow TF MW personnel to conduct deputy meeting
END STATE: TF MOUNTAIN WARRIOR ground forces successfully regain control of Barge Matal and general populations confidence is restored in GIRoA. 
Narrative of major events: WPN 13 and WPN 20 departed JAF at 2134 Z to Barge Matal.  The team provided area security over Barge Matal with NSTR.  The flight departed the Barge Matal area around 0540Z .  At 0608Z while transiting the Kamdesh Valley heading towards FOB Bostick, CF at the COP Lowell West OP reported observing 10 rounds of small arms fire directed at the trail aircraft WPN 13 (A/C #113).  The reported POO was IVO  42S YE 191 211.  The crew did not observe the fire and continued to FOB Bostick for refuel, then returned to JAF without further incident.  During post flight inspecting the crew observed damage caused by a single round to a main rotor blade.

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: The Kamdesh Valley remains the highest threat area for aircraft within N2KL.  COP Lowell has been regularly engaged 11 times in the last 15 days, with several complex engagements utilizing multiple firing points and multiple weapon systems (DF and IDF). Recent engagements have also utilized a B-10 recoilless rifle system against the COP. There have been four previous offensive SAFIREs in this valley within the last 60 days.  The most recent engagement occurred on 13 July 09 when AAF targeted an AWT travelling east near COP Lowell with a DShK HMG, striking the bottom of the aircraft at the front seat.  The other events have targeted lift aircraft both on the HLZ at COP Lowell and descending towards COP Keating. Due to ongoing operations at Barge Matal there have been numerous aircraft transiting the Kamdesh district between the FARP at FOB Bostick and the objective area at Barge Matal.  This has provided AAF innumerable opportunities to observe A/C traversing the narrow Kamdesh Valley and prepare for an offensive engagement against A/C.   The successful attacks at Barge Matal and successful SAFIRE engagement on 13 July 09 has likely bolstered AAF morale, increasing the likelihood of SAFIRE attempts.  While an HMG was not used during today's incident, they have been previously used against aircraft and caches discovered in Barge Matal have contained ammunition for these systems. Based on this increased threat aircraft should utilize alternate routes to bypass the Kamdesh Valley, particularly the area near COP Lowell, when travelling to Barge Matal.  Aircraft should also utilize evasive TTPs, leveraging altitude and airspeed when possible, to avoid a repeat engagement.

The vehicle increased speed, flashed light signals and reduced its distance with the convoy below 50 m. The gunner gave, additionally to the used signs on the vehicle, hand signs, but the pick up kept its speed. He immediately reported to convoy commander, who ordered to repeat the hand signs and to fire a warning shot out of the machine gun (MG3 - 7,62 mm) if necessary. After the rear gunner repeated the hand signs effortlessly he gave a warning shot (burst). The car immediately increased the distance about to 150 - 200 m. Then, after a few seconds, the car increased the speed again and came close to the convoy (50 m and less), the gunner fired a second warning shot (burst). Then the pick up left the scene in northern direction. No casualties were reported. During this EOF 9 rounds of ammunition were fired. NFTR.

Narrative of Major Events: At approx 0730Z OD Flight departed Bostick ISO TIC at Barge Matal.  OD Flight received SAF(grid UNK), confirmed by ground forces in the VIC of COP Lowell but proceeded to Barge Matal because of troops in contact situation.  Once on station, Chosen 97 reported that CF had taken significant SAF/RPG fire from a ridge line to the SW and that ground troops had just engaged the site with mortars.  OD flight PID  1xindividual at 42S YE 1147 4970.  Chosen 97 confirmed the location and cleared OD to engage.  OD engaged with 120x.30mm and confirmed 1xEKIA.  Chosen 97 then asked OD flight to search cornfields due south of Barge Matal from which CF had received continuous SAF/RPG fire.  OD PID 4-5xMAMs hiding in the fields close to a telephone pole IVO Grid YE 1186 4995.  Chosen 97 identified the individuals as hostile and cleared OD to engage.  ISR later confirmed 5xunmoving heat signatures in that location, believed to be 5xEKIA.  Chosen 97 then tasked OD flight to investigate a house approx 30m south of grid YE 1200 4977 that was a confirmed AAF safe house and had no civilians inside.  OD PID the house at grid YE 1203 4975 and marked with .30mm.  Chosen 97 confirmed the location and OD engaged with 1xN-model Hellfire missile and 60x.30mm.  BDA was unconfirmed but the house was destroyed.  Chosen 97 then informed OD of another house to the west of the previous house that was also a confirmed AAF safe house with no civilians and asked OD to engage.  OD PID the house and engaged with 1xK2A and 40x.30mm.  Chosen 97 stated that the enemy ICOM chatter coming from the house stopped in mid sentence the moment the missile hit.  Chosen 97 then reported that they had one fleeing individual in black traditional Afghan attire.  The individual proceeded east across the river into a cornfield on the eastern bank. OD confirmed the individual in the cornfield; the person was stumbling and was armed with an AK47.  Chosen 97 cleared OD to engage.  OD engaged with 10x.30mm but did not kill the person.  OD engaged with another volley of 10x.30mm rounds but the individual had been pulled into a house by another person by the time the second burst impacted.  OD 43 was then Winchester on 30mm and missiles and switched positions with OD 41. OD Flight continued overhead security until Bingo fuel and then proceeded to Bostick to FARP.   While en route to Bostick two separate GFC reported SAF SAFIRE events against the OD flight at 42S YE 1966 2083 and YE 126 210.  OD flight did not prosecute either location due to the situation at Barge Matal.  Once back on station, OD observed almost no activity IVO Barge Matal for the next two hours.  OD proceeded back to the SAFIRE site at YE 126 210 and searched the area but did not PID any personnel.  OD flight then moved to YE 1966 2100 but again did not PIE any armed individuals in the area.  OD then returned to Bostick for re-fuel and RTB to BAF.

TF EAGLE LIFT S2 Assessment: Due to on-going operations at Barge Matal, AAF have ample opportunities to engage aircraft transiting in the Kamdesh  valley, currently considered the most dangerous valley in the NKL region for aircraft.  Expect target of opportunity SAFIREs to continue with likely points of origin from the southern ridge of the Kamdesh , concentrating in the Kamu area.

Narrative of Major Events: At approx 0730Z OD Flight departed Bostick ISO TIC at Barge Matal.  OD Flight received SAF(grid UNK), confirmed by ground forces in the VIC of COP Lowell but proceeded to Barge Matal because of troops in contact situation.  Once on station, Chosen 97 reported that CF had taken significant SAF/RPG fire from a ridge line to the SW and that ground troops had just engaged the site with mortars.  OD flight PID  1xindividual at 42S YE 1147 4970.  Chosen 97 confirmed the location and cleared OD to engage.  OD engaged with 120x.30mm and confirmed 1xEKIA.  Chosen 97 then asked OD flight to search cornfields due south of Barge Matal from which CF had received continuous SAF/RPG fire.  OD PID 4-5xMAMs hiding in the fields close to a telephone pole IVO Grid YE 1186 4995.  Chosen 97 identified the individuals as hostile and cleared OD to engage.  ISR later confirmed 5xunmoving heat signatures in that location, believed to be 5xEKIA.  Chosen 97 then tasked OD flight to investigate a house approx 30m south of grid YE 1200 4977 that was a confirmed AAF safe house and had no civilians inside.  OD PID the house at grid YE 1203 4975 and marked with .30mm.  Chosen 97 confirmed the location and OD engaged with 1xN-model Hellfire missile and 60x.30mm.  BDA was unconfirmed but the house was destroyed.  Chosen 97 then informed OD of another house to the west of the previous house that was also a confirmed AAF safe house with no civilians and asked OD to engage.  OD PID the house and engaged with 1xK2A and 40x.30mm.  Chosen 97 stated that the enemy ICOM chatter coming from the house stopped in mid sentence the moment the missile hit.  Chosen 97 then reported that they had one fleeing individual in black traditional Afghan attire.  The individual proceeded east across the river into a cornfield on the eastern bank. OD confirmed the individual in the cornfield; the person was stumbling and was armed with an AK47.  Chosen 97 cleared OD to engage.  OD engaged with 10x.30mm but did not kill the person.  OD engaged with another volley of 10x.30mm rounds but the individual had been pulled into a house by another person by the time the second burst impacted.  OD 43 was then Winchester on 30mm and missiles and switched positions with OD 41. OD Flight continued overhead security until Bingo fuel and then proceeded to Bostick to FARP.   While en route to Bostick two separate GFC reported SAF SAFIRE events against the OD flight at 42S YE 1966 2083 and YE 126 210.  OD flight did not prosecute either location due to the situation at Barge Matal.  Once back on station, OD observed almost no activity IVO Barge Matal for the next two hours.  OD proceeded back to the SAFIRE site at YE 126 210 and searched the area but did not PID any personnel.  OD flight then moved to YE 1966 2100 but again did not PIE any armed individuals in the area.  OD then returned to Bostick for re-fuel and RTB to BAF.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
T1: Conduct R&S IVO Pech and Korengal Valleys ISO Pech resupply. 
Narrative of Major Events: Overdrive  (OD) departed to conduct Pesh Resupply mission.  Due to late shift in beginning of mission, AWT continued to Korengal valley to recon due to S-2 threat assessment.  On arrival, Baker Fires lit overt illumination rounds on a hillside.  OD Contacted Baker Fires who reported LOBs from KOP on 020 and 052.  While conducting recce of these hillsides, OD observed several MAM who immediately and continuously hid amongst the trees and rocks.  OD conducted test fire at the request of Baker Fires with 30mm and rockets.  During this test fire, OD 44 received small arms fire IVO //MGRS 42S XD 7887 6467//.  OD suppressed the area at the request of Baker Fires, and recommended a linear sheath area to Baker Fires, who engaged with a fire for effect mission (XD 7887 6499 to XD 7876 6521).  OD departed to refuel and  rearm at Abad.  OD linked up with Big Time (BT / CH-47) FLT and continued mission. On arrival back to the Korengal, Baker Fires relayed that Baker 91 was on a patrol to locate enemy personnel.  OD began the escort for the BT element, when OD observed the same MAMs who had been hiding in the area earlier. Baker 91 (GFC) confirmed these individuals as enemy with hostile intent.  Baker 91 (initials BB) requested OD engage a house IVO //MGRS 42S XD 7742 6521//.  OD obtained PID on house from Baker 91, and Baker Fires confirmed CDE and absence of friendly personnel in the area. OD then engaged the house with two N-model Hellfire missiles at 2030Z.  OD continued  the rest of the mission with NFTR. 

TF EAGLE LIFT S2 Assessment: The last SAFIRE in the Pech or Korengal Valleys was on a TF PALEHORSE SWT providing support for troops in contact during a resupply mission on 15JUL09.  This is assessed as a minor target of opportunity (defensive) SAFIRE.  The AAF were likely firing at the sound of the aircraft in response to the test fires requested by the ground unit.  Both recent and historical SIGINT has indicated the enemys intent to target A/C.  Past SIGACTs have confirmed the presence of HMGs and reporting has indicated the presence of other anti air weapons and specialist.  It is assessed that the enemy may attempt a coordinated air/ground ambush IOT bring down and A/C.  Air crews should continue to vary flight routes and utilize high flight profiles to minimize their exposure to direct fire weapons.  Expect TOO (offensive) and TOO (defensive) SAFIREs to continue in this area as the fighting season continues.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
TF Attack Player A/C provides air support for Air Assault into OBJ 3A2 ISO Operation Yukon Recovery
Narrative of Major Events: Player 05/02 departed Salerno at 2105Z and proceeded to Sharana at 2140Z in preparation for INFIL into Yukon Recovery 3A2.  PL departed Sharana at 2315Z and proceeded directly to OBJ YR 3A2 to INFIL Hatchet 6 ISO Yukons personnel recovery mission.  Player 05/02 had nothing to report from the OBJ area and arrived Sharana at 2345Z.  Player departed Sharana at 0018Z and RTB.  At 0030Z, PL was transiting south around the Zerok No Fly Zone heading back into SAL.  Both A/C were traveling at 140kts at a 60 heading  as they were climbing over the mountains when the lead A/C observed three sets of 6-10 muzzle flashes originating from a hill top at their 2 oclock IVO WB 35487 57507.  The ramp gunner heard audible pops and observed two red tracer rounds at the aircrafts 5 and 6 oclock.  The ramp gunner reported the tracers were traveling approximately 1/4 mile west of the A/C.  PL reported approximately 20 Kuchi tents at WB 3592 5795  IVO the SAFIRE POO.  A/C continued to climb over the mountains heading toward Salerno.  Player shut down at Salerno at 0047Z with NFTR.

TF ATTACK S2 Assessment:  The areas between the ranges west of Zerok COP out to the Bermel PASS and over the PK border are hot spots for TOO SAFIREs.  The area is inhabited by nomadic Kuchis who periodically engage ISAF and Contract Air with SAF.  The Player A/C traveled straight line back to Salerno transiting closely around the Zerok No Fly Zone.  It is likely Kuchis have taken note of the CH-47s who regularly fly through the area when returning from PR AASLTS.  However, there are no Significant or Major SAFIREs reported in this area.  This area is notorious for Minor SAFIREs and deliberate IDF attacks on A/C while on Tillmans LZ.

Update:  Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report.(See attached media and assoicated report.) Summary from Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report. (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 170800D* Jul 09, an AUP patrol with one vehicle and four AUP personal onboard left their police district headquarter in order to patrol the area in district 3. At approx 0855D* while traveling EAST on rte ABIGAIL, one police officer found a suspected IED at GR 41R QR 59642 01121. The AUP set up a cordon and requested assistance from the CF. QRF with CIED assets was deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS). They arrived on site at approx 0954D* and began the exploitation. At approx 0959D* while doing their cordon, a CF element saw a white van trying to pass trough the cordon. The CF element on the cordon followed their RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (ROE) procedure and the white van didnt stop. The CF element engaged the vehicle with small arms and forced the van to stop. One LN KIA and two LN WIA resulted from this escalation of force. It is presumed that the white van tried to force the cordon in order to proof it for INS future ops. The CF elements evacuated the casualties and continued with the investigation of the IED site. An improvise claymore filled with UBE with a suspected LONG RANGE CORDLESS PHONE (LRCP) were found conceal inside a green plastic bag. The IED was a RCIED and multiple firing point were observed due to its location.

UPDATE FROM FIR 1523D*
While halted at IED site (ISAF  07-1495), QRF and 20 x ANP established a cordon on the site. A minivan approached the cordon at high speed (30-40km). The PRT gunner conducted proper EoF procedures using manual and verbal signals, warning shot; pen flares and finally engaged with C9 and C7.  As a result of the engagement the QRF injured 2 x AC and killed 1 AC. The PRT AMB and Medic on scene treated the injured ACs wounds.  ANP evacuated the killed AC. The QRF AMB evacuated the 2 x AC to CNS. After medical assessment in CNS, MEDEVAV was requested. Both injured were evacuated via medevac to CAMP HERO. CIMIC will prepare to pay the proper respect to the family. The PRT will meet with the GoK and CoP to discuss the incident and ensure that AC understand the dangers of driving rapidly towards FF convoys and not adhering to the warning signals. IO is fully engaged in the incident to assist in passing the message. A national investigation was initiated as AC were killed and injured by CAN actions. A/OC Stab A initial assessment is that the soldier progressed through the EoF in an appropriate manor. KPRT Ops O:  This is one of the first times that Civ veh are ignoring that many CF on the ground. There was no apparent negative reaction by AC in the vicinity.

NARRATIVE OF EVENTS: 
AT 0542Z, PEDRO55 (2500FT AGL, 115 KTS, 040 HDG), EXPERIENCED AN MWS INDICATION AND DISPENSED FLARES. PEDRO55 ASCENDED TO 2,500 FEET AND BEGAN ORBITING WHEN PILOT AND FLIGHT ENGINEER OBSERVED A LARGE, GREY SMOKE CLOUD 500FT BELOW THE A/C AND IVO THEIR PREVIOUS FLIGHT PATH. WEAPON13 AND GROUND ELEMENTS WERE ALSO DISCUSSING THE RPG POINT OF ORIGIN AT THE TIME OF THE ENGAGEMENT. CREW CONTINUED TO SUPPORT A SEPARATE CASEVAC MISSION AND COMPLETED MISSION WITH NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE. 

ISRD ASSESSMENT: 
INFORMATION PROVIDED IS CONSISTENT WITH A RPG. ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON AIRCREW POST-FLIGHT TAPE REVIEW AND REPORTING OF GROUND UNIT OBSERVATIONS. 
PEDRO55 HAD BEEN INFORMED DURING TAKE-OFF OF EF INTENT TO TARGET MEDEVAC HELOS AND HAD BEEN ON STATION FOR ~12 MINS PRIOR TO BEING ENGAGED. THERE WAS ALSO AN AH-64 ON STATION PROVIDING OVERWATCH, MAKING THE HH-60 A MORE APPEALING TARGET FOR EF. EF TARGETED COP LOWELL WITH RPG, BELT-FED, AND IDF POSSIBLY INTENDING TO INJURE CF. THIS WOULD IN TURN NECESSITATE A MEDEVAC MISSION. 
THIS EVENT COULD HAVE BEEN A PLANNED ATTACK AGAINST A MEDEVAC ASSET, ALTHOUGH, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. WITH THE INTERCEPTED ICOM CHATTER, IT IS POSSIBLE EF WISHED TO LURE MEDEVAC ASSETS TO THIS COP AND AMBUSH THEM WITH MULTIPLE 
WEAPON TYPES, HOWEVER, ONLY THE RPG WAS USED AGAINST THEM PROBABLY DUE TO THE HEIGHT OF THE A/C AND THE ASSESSED EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RPG. THIS EVENT ILLUSTRATES THE VALUE OF INTERCEPTED ICOM CHATTER AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RELAYING CRITICAL INFORMATION IN A TIMELY MANNER AS WAS DONE DURING THIS MISSION.
 
ALTHOUGH THIS ATTACK WAS UNSUCCESSFUL, THIS AREA IS STILL A HIGH-OPS AREA AND SAFIRE EVENTS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE WITH FURTHER RW ASSISTANCE TO GROUND FORCES. 
THERE HAVE BEEN 3 SAFIRES W/I 10NM IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. 2 X SMARMS VS RW (1 X HIT), 1 X BF VS RW (1 X HIT)

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: AAF are continuing to target A/C, armed or not, across AO Mountain Warrior.  Within the last 72 hours there have been 11 flights engaged by AAF in AO Mountain Warrior.  Four of these occurred on 15 July 09 during an attack against a CF dismounted patrol across the river from Matin Village near the Shuryak Valley.  SIGINT intercepted after this engagement indicated separate C2 elements had coordinated their actions to increase the lethality of the attack in the Watapor Valley.  Prior to that attack AAF cells had rarely conducted sustained attacks in the Pech Valley in the face of R/W and F/W CAS support.  So far there have been five reported SAFIRE incidents during the 17 July 09 attack in the Watapor Valley, which has lasted over eight hours.  HUMINT reporting for the last seven days has identified foreign fighters and resupply of weapons and ammunition moving into the Shigal and Watapor Valleys.  The presence of these fighters as well as the sustained engagement on 15 July 09 may account for the sustained engagement today.  Based on the reports from the crew, damage to the aircraft, and recovered rounds, it is clear SWT 1 was engaged by a DShK.  Based on the angle of the impact and angle of the aircraft it is likely that the system was emplaced to the east of the Watapor, level to or above the aircraft.  HUMINT reporting regularly indicates DShKs are present in the northern reaches of the Watapor Valley.  This is the first known use of this system south of Qatar Kala Village.  This move south is likely due to LN pressure following LN casualties caused by AAF during ambushes against CF convoys to Qatar Kala village in March 09.  The increase in SAFIRE events has been matched with an increase in different engagement methods and weapons systems.  Aircraft have been targeted with IDF systems on HLZs on four occasions in the last thirty days.  Aircraft have been targeted offensively in flight (separate from ground engagements) on three occasions in the last four days.  Aircraft continue to be targeted when conducting CCAs.  This increase indicates AAF are seeking out engagements to down an aircraft to achieve a significant IO victory and gain operational momentum.  This increase also indicates AAF in many areas of N2KL are not deterred by the presence of attack and scout aircraft.  The highest threat areas remain the same: the Kamdesh Valley and Pech Valley.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
Provide QRF and security for MEDVAC in AO Mtn Warrior.
Narrative of major events:
Night AH-64 QRF departed JAF at 2126Z to FOB Bostick to provide QRF to forces at Barge Matal.  While at FOB Bostick, WPN 15 had a maintenance issue, and was grounded.  At 0510Z COP Lowell reported taking SAF and RPG fire.  WPN 13 launched with USAF HH-60 CSAR (Pedro 55) to MEDEVAC a patient from COP Lowell.  Ground elements passed a spot of enemy personnel at grid 42S YE 2040 1970.  WPN 13 engaged the personnel with 40x 30mm, killing the single personnel based on lack of movement following the engagement.  Pedro 55 completed the MEDEVAC, reporting SAF directed at both Pedro and the WPN 13 during the MEDEVAC from an unknown location.  The WPN element did not observe the fire.  Once WPN 15 was repaired the AWT departed FOB Bostick to respond to an ongoing engagement in the Watapor Valley.  Once arriving overhead a SWT already on station marked a suspected DShK position at 42S XD 9234 6902.  The AWT suppressed this area with 250x 30mm and 26 rockets.  BDA could not be confirmed.  The flight then returned to JAF at 1000Z with NFTR.

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment:
The Kamdesh Valley remains the highest threat area for aircraft within N2KL.  COP Lowell has been regularly engaged 11 times in the last 15 days, with several complex engagements utilizing multiple firing points and multiple weapon systems (DF and IDF). Recent engagements have also utilized a B-10 recoilless rifle system against the COP. There have been four previous offensive SAFIREs in this valley within the last 60 days.  The most recent engagement occurred on 13 July 09 when AAF targeted an AWT travelling east near COP Lowell with a DShK HMG, striking the bottom of the aircraft at the co-pilot gunner station.  The other events have targeted lift aircraft both on the HLZ at COP Lowell and descending towards COP Keating. Due to ongoing operations at Barge Matal there have been numerous aircraft transiting the Kamdesh district between the FARP at FOB Bostick and the objective area at Barge Matal.  This has provided AAF innumerable opportunities to observe A/C traversing the narrow Kamdesh Valley and prepare for an offensive engagement against A/C.  SIGINT reporting and recent events have shown cells in the Kamdesh Valley will seek out offensive engagements against all types of aircraft, including AWTs.  The successful attacks at Barge Matal and successful SAFIRE engagement on 13 July 09 has likely bolstered AAF morale, increasing the likelihood of SAFIRE attempts.  While an HMG was not used during today's incident, they have been previously used against aircraft and caches discovered in Barge Matal have contained ammunition for these systems. Based on this increased threat aircraft should utilize increased evasive TTPs when operating near COP Lowell.

Narrative of major events: Departed Bostic to reposition Dustoff 24 back at JAF.  Upon departure at 0550Z, received notification en route that 9-line was dropping in vicinity of COP Honaker-Miracle.  Arrived mouth of Pech valley and held until cleared in by escort  of Palehorse elements (OH-58D).  Went in to POI and hoisted medic down at 0640Z, and left scene at 0642Z.  Returned at 0658Z, and hoisted up one patient.  During hoist, 10-15 rounds of small arms automatic fire struck terrain 25 meters from the nose of dustoff aircraft.  Departed scene at 0700Z.  Arrived Abad at 0705Z and dropped off patient and took on fuel.  Departed Abad at 0712Z.  Returned to POI at 0715Z.  Hoisted out two patients, and departed POI at 0723Z.  Relocated to Honiker-Miracle, where we picked up water and supplies for troops at POI.  Returned to POI at 0746Z and dropped off water.  During drop off, small arms fire struck terrain adjacent to aircraft.  Left scene with no additional patients at 0749z.  Returned to poi at 0758z, and hoisted 2 heat casualty patients, and left scene at 0800z.  Returned to poi at 0805z to extract medic.  Left POI with medic at 0807z, and relocated to Abad, wheels down Abad at 0810z.  Off Abad with patient for transfer to JAF at 1008z.  Down JAF at 1034Z.  Mission complete. 

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: AAF are continuing to target A/C, armed or not, across AO Mountain Warrior.  Within the last 72 hours there have been 11 flights engaged by AAF in AO Mountain Warrior.  Four of these occurred on 15 July 09 during an attack against a CF dismounted patrol across the river from Matin Village near the Shuryak Valley.  SIGINT intercepted after this engagement indicated separate C2 elements had coordinated their actions to increase the lethality of the attack in the Watapor Valley.  Prior to that attack AAF cells had rarely conducted sustained attacks in the Pech Valley in the face of R/W and F/W CAS support.  So far there have been five reported SAFIRE incidents during the 17 July 09 attack in the Watapor Valley, which has lasted over eight hours.  HUMINT reporting for the last seven days has identified foreign fighters and resupply of weapons and ammunition moving into the Shigal and Watapor Valleys.  The presence of these fighters as well as the sustained engagement on 15 July 09 may account for the sustained engagement today.  Based on the reports from the crew, damage to the aircraft, and recovered rounds, it is clear SWT 1 was engaged by a DShK.  Based on the angle of the impact and angle of the aircraft it is likely that the system was emplaced to the east of the Watapor, level to or above the aircraft.  HUMINT reporting regularly indicates DShKs are present in the northern reaches of the Watapor Valley.  This is the first known use of this system south of Qatar Kala Village.  This move south is likely due to LN pressure following LN casualties caused by AAF during ambushes against CF convoys to Qatar Kala village in March 09.  The increase in SAFIRE events has been matched with an increase in different engagement methods and weapons systems.  Aircraft have been targeted with IDF systems on HLZs on four occasions in the last thirty days.  Aircraft have been targeted offensively in flight (separate from ground engagements) on three occasions in the last four days.  Aircraft continue to be targeted when conducting CCAs.  This increase indicates AAF are seeking out engagements to down an aircraft to achieve a significant IO victory and gain operational momentum.  This increase also indicates AAF in many areas of N2KL are not deterred by the presence of attack and scout aircraft.  The highest threat areas remain the same: the Kamdesh Valley and Pech Valley.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
MSN: NLT 17 0530z JUL 09 TF PALEHORSE conducts area reconnaissance in the Nari and Gehazi Abad Districts to disrupt AAF LOCs and enhance CF FOM within AO DESTROYER 
Narrative of major events: 0520 SWT 3 departed JAF and received mission update to BHO with SWT 2 in the Watapor valley. SWT 3 bypassed ABAD and linked up with MEDEVAC at the Pech valley and escorted the MEDEVAC to HONAKER-MIRACLE SWT 2 and 1 suppressed the terrain around the LZ vic XD 9255 6875.  On the last pass by SWT 1 they reported taking HMG fire from a DshK on the west ridge and sustained damage and that they were departing for Abad to conduct BDA.
Once SWT 2 BHO complete, SWT 3 called in the MEDEVAC for a hoist mission and told Charlie 37 to put the most urgent patient of the three up the hoist first.  As Dustoff was short final they observed SAF from the west ridge at 300 degrees from their heading.  SWT 3 engaged the area and took fire as they broke to the south.  Charlie 37 reported they were running out of ammo and water so SWT 3 coordinated with Flawless (UH-60) to get a speed ball from FOB Blessing.  We continued to supress the area as Dustoff inserted the medic via hoist.
Dustoff departed with the medic on the ground due to SAF.  Dustoff conducted 4-5 hoist missions extracting all the patients and the medic and returned to Abad.  SWT 3 continued to conduct BHO with Hawg 55, SWT 2,4 to maintain continuous coverage.  
SWT 3 received report that Flawless escorted by Overdrive was going to insert 10-11 QRF troops into the LZ to support the exfil of the C37 element.  As Flawless was loading at FOB Blessing the LZ took IDF and they had to depart early and the artillery mission was canceled.  SWT 3 supressed the area and handed the area off to Overdrive and we reported the LZ as cherry with a DshK on the west ridge line.  As Flawless inserted the troops overdrive took HMG fire and sustained damage to the flight control system and departed to make an emergency landing at Abad.  SWT 3 closed with Flawless and supressed the area as the departed and observed them depart trail with the trail Overdrive to Abad.
SWT 3 BHO with SWT4 and went to Abad for refuel.  Due to the battle damaged aircraft at Abad SWT 3 only had access to one pad for refuel and rearm,  Jaguar 13 took control of the PZ and began cycling in the fuel critical aircraft and maintaining control of the airspace.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
TF Lift (-) conducts CCA ISO of TF Lethal NLT 170730ZJUL09.
Narrative of Major Events: AH-64 DQRF departed BAF en route FOB Bostick.  On arrival at Bostick OD was re-tasked to respond to a TIC IVO of Honaker Miracle at 42S XD 9285 6933.  Two teams of OH58Ds (Pale) were on station, with Hog over head and Chosen 93 on the ground.  Pale elements were acting as the on scene commander/JTAC controlling all air assets and developing the situation.  Once OD was on station the Pale elements attempted to mark two targets on a spur IVO the previous grid, with smoke and WP Rockets.  Enemy personnel were spotted moving toward the friendly position in the adjacent draw.  OD and Pale laid suppressive fire on those locations.  OD 44 covered OD 42 until a MEDEVAC aircraft conducting hoist operations in the area began taking fire.  At this point OD 44 began making diving fire runs IOT suppress the AAF  of the MEDEVAC.  OD 44 made three passes with .30mm, ensuring they never overflew their target area.  On the fourth pass, OD 44 received one round of 7.62mm which cut the utility hydraulic line causing multiple systems to fail within the aircraft.  The angle of the SAFIRE was directly beneath the aircraft indicating that the enemy had positions further up the ridgeline from those engaged during the .30mm runs.  The SAFIRE firing position was very well concealed and OD 44 could not identify the shooter.  OD 44 immediately headed out of the Pech Valley and flew to Asadabad in order to conduct BDA. 42S  XD  92862  69236
TF EAGLE LIFT & TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: AAF are continuing to target A/C, armed or not, across AO Mountain Warrior.  In the last 72 hours AAF engaged 11 flights in AO Mountain Warrior.  Four of these occurred during an engagement against a dismounted patrol across the river from Matin Village on 15JUL09.   Prior to that attack, AAF cells had rarely conducted sustained attacks in the Pech valley in the face of R/W and F/W CAS support.  So far there have been five reported SAFIRE incidents during the 17JUL09 engagement in the Watapor Valley, which lasted over eight hours.  Reporting for the last seven days indicated foreign fighters and a resupply of weapons and ammunition recently moved into the Shigal and Watapor Valleys. Based on the reports from the crew, damage to the aircraft, and recovered rounds, one of the afore-mentioned SWTs was engaged by a DShK system. Based on the angle of the impact and angle of the aircraft it is likely that the system was emplaced to the east, level to or above the aircraft.  Reporting regularly indicates DShKs are present in the northern reaches of the Watapor Valley.  This is the first known use of this system south of Qatar Kala Village.  The damage to the AH64 is consistent with a 7.62mm round in that no remnants of the bullet were found during post-flight inspection. The damage also indicated the round did not have armor piercing capabilities.  The increase in targeting aircraft conducting CCAs indicates AAF in many areas of N2KL are not deterred by the presence of attack and scout aircraft.  The highest threat areas remain the same:  the Kamdesh Valley and Pech Valley.

So far there have been five reported SAFIRE incidents during the 17 July 09 attack in the Watapor Valley, which has lasted over eight hours.  HUMINT reporting for the last seven days has identified foreign fighters and resupply of weapons and ammunition moving into the Shigal and Watapor Valleys.  The presence of these fighters as well as the sustained engagement on 15 July 09 may account for the sustained engagement today.  Based on the reports from the crew, damage to the aircraft, and recovered rounds, it is clear SWT 1 was engaged by a DShK.  Based on the angle of the impact and angle of the aircraft it is likely that the system was emplaced to the east of the Watapor, level to or above the aircraft.  HUMINT reporting regularly indicates DShKs are present in the northern reaches of the Watapor Valley.  This is the first known use of this system south of Qatar Kala Village.  This move south is likely due to LN pressure following LN casualties caused by AAF during ambushes against CF convoys to Qatar Kala village in March 09.  The increase in SAFIRE events has been matched with an increase in different engagement methods and weapons systems.  Aircraft have been targeted with IDF systems on HLZs on four occasions in the last thirty days.  Aircraft have been targeted offensively in flight (separate from ground engagements) on three occasions in the last four days.  Aircraft continue to be targeted when conducting CCAs.  This increase indicates AAF are seeking out engagements to down an aircraft to achieve a significant IO victory and gain operational momentum.  This increase also indicates AAF in many areas of N2KL are not deterred by the presence of attack and scout aircraft.  The highest threat areas remain the same: the Kamdesh Valley and Pech Valley.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: TF  Eagle Lift A/C provides air support for Air Assaults ISO Operation Yukon Recovery
Narrative of Major Events: Bigtime 57 and 63 flying from Kushamond to Sharana.  At 1814Z, while aircraft were transiting over the village of Samamolzi, 26 KM southwest of Sharana, the flight took fire from the 3 oclock position from  approx  mile away. The flight was in a staggered left formation with approximately 6-7 rotor disc separation between the aircraft on a 052 degree heading at 133 knots and 600 feet AGL.  The rocket passed between the two aircraft and Chalk 2 announced to Chalk 1 that they were taking fire from the 3 oclock position and conducting evasive maneuvers. In addition to the rocket that split the formation, a second rocket and tracer fire were observed by a crew member on Chalk 1. The second rocket exploded near the ground.

TF ATTACK S2 Assessment:  There has been one SAFIRE within 10 NM of this event in the past 30 days.  On 04JUL09, Puma Aircraft transiting through the area observed individuals in a grove of trees who fired SAF directed at the aircraft.  The aircraft was not hit.  The attack today is assessed as a target of opportunity offensive engagement.  There has been a dramatic increase in aircraft traffic throughout Western Paktika and Eastern Ghazni since 30JUN09 and the beginning of DUSTWUN Recovery Operations.  There was no HUMINT or SIGINT associated with this event.

Summary from duplicate effort
-----------------------------
0510z: 2/B/2-12 IN with the M-ETT/ANA found an IED @ XD 75788 64056. There was no RC Unit attached to the IED. It was a Command Wire IED with C-4(4"" x 18""). M-ETT/ANA are bringing the IED back to the Korengal Outpost ATT. 

0759: M-ETT/ANA RP COP Korengal with the IED. Patrol is sending pictures of the IED components. IED was not completed. 

1114z: Update from B/2-12 IN: The wire was rolled up and put in a hollowed out tree about 100m from the road. The battery pack was about 5 feet away under a rock. Looks like the only thing they needed to add was the explosive, then close the circuit with another battery.

The IED consisted of a pressure plate, and a yellow improvised plastic

underneath the main charge. The main charge was burned in place by (1) thermite. It
burned for approximately 45 minutes. It is EODs assessment that the IED was emplaced
approximately 1-2 weeks ago. The bottom side of the pressure plate was caked with hard

The crews reported that the DSHKA/RPG position is tucked away into a draw not visible to Lowell, Fritche, or Keating.  After continuing mission to conduct security at Barge Matal, AWT returned to Bostick and shut down as standby for QRF. While in TOC, crew heard LLVI chatter of AAF saying they were in position and ready to attack again when needed. AWT responded to downed OH58D by COP Pirtle King and conducted area security until RTB at JAF at approximately 0730Z.

 TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment: In the last 7 days there have been three SAFIREs and two CCAs IVO COP Lowell.  Though the SAFIREs occurred in different locations, these events concentrate in the central Kamdesh Valley near COP Lowell. LLVI out of COP Keating and OP Mace, at either ends of the Kamdesh valley, indicate AAF intend to target any A/C traveling through these valleys, armed or not.  HUMINT reporting over the past ten days has repeatedly indicated AAF intent to target aircraft supporting CF operations in Barge Matal. Based on LLVI intercepts it is likely that AAF have an extensive communication network that provides early warning of aircraft moving north from Nari District to the Kamdesh and Barge Matal districts. It is likely that the CF operations in Barge Matal allowed AAF to identify aircraft flight patterns and identify a vulnerable ambush point.  The weapons used in today's engagement were well hidden to avoid detection by the AH-64s, and placed within a draw to provide concealment from CF position at COP Lowell and COP Keating.  Based on the pilots assessment of the AAF planned engagement area this position likely was chosen to target aircraft using the B-K Pass route to bypass the Kamdesh Valley.  Despite numerous successful CCAs there has been no intelligence reporting to indicate AAF have been dissuaded from targeting aircraft.  Following a successful SAFIRE that struck an aircraft on 13 July 09 and forced the aircraft to RTB AAF will likely continue to seek out engagements against aircraft in the hopes of downing one.  Based on recent events the Kamdesh Valley near Mirdesh Village is the highest threat area to aircraft.  AAF will likely use HMG and RPG fire as their main weapon systems and engage from positions in the high ground of the ridgelines to the south of the Valley.  These events may become more lethal if AAF decide to conduct a complex attack like the one near COP Lowell from both the north and south ridgelines, catching A/C in a cross fire.

Narrative of Major Events: At approximately 1020Z PAW 30, while flying from Zormat to Band E Sardeh (500 AGL, 120KTS, heading 347) observed a single MAM exit his home with an unknown long object at the ready. As the aircraft passed overhead the crew heard a single chunk.  Upon return to FOB Sharana the aircraft was inspected and a single hole was located in the tail boom entering at the aft right and exiting a few inches forward on the left side of the tail boom.  Damage found to be cosmetic
only.

TF Thunder Assessment: There have not been any SAFIREs within 10NM of this event in the last 30 days. The last SAFIRE to occur IVO this locale was on 26MAY09, and involved a TF WINGS CH-47 that was hit with SAF in the right main fuel cell while conducting a Czech PDSS mission. Expect SAFIREs in this region to likely comprise effective offensive TOO engagements consisting of AK variant weapon systems.

A big column of cars had already formed behind the truck. The driver and machine gunner from FF tried several times to warn the driver to pull off (with hand signals, motor  horn and car lights) but without effect: the driver continued to drive on the middle of the road. Then the machine gunner made 3 single x 7.62mm warning shots into the air and the truck eventually pulled over. When FF overtook the truck, our soldiers saw the driver of the vehicle smiling.

Summary: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 200545D* Jul 09, fifteen dismounted AUP left POLICE SUB STATION (PSS) eight in order to patrol rte PASCALE. The night before the AUP checkpoint at GR 41R QR 53304 03585 was engaged with small arm fire (SAF) from rte PASCALE and the AUP wanted to patrol it in order to do a BATTLE DAMMAGE ASSESSMENT (BDA). At approx 0600D* while travelling WEST on rte PASCALE at GR 41R QR 52811 03177 they found what they suspected to be an IED made with two yellow jug. One jug was half buried and the other was 5m WEST of the first one on the top of the road. The AUP set up a cordon and requested assistance from the CF. QRF with CIED assets was deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS). QRF arrived on site at approx 0948D* and CIED began the exploitation. Two yellow plastic jugs were found with no power source connected to. When EOD emptied them they found an improvise anti-tilt system inside one of the jug. With the evidence found on site, it is suspected that the INS were disturb the night before by AUP when emplacing their IED. This is probably why the IED wasnt connected to a power source. This IED was emplaced in order to target ANSF or first responders who would touch the main charge and it would strike as soon as lifted.

Summary
At 210715D*Jul 09, the QRF from FORWARD OPERATON BASE MASUM GHAR (FMG) deployed to investigate an IED site on RTE HYENA at GR 41R QQ 30773 90317, 365m NORTH-EAST from OP MOSQUE. As the ANA were doing their morning road sweep on rte HYENA, the ANA found an IED, just before a culvert. The ANA investigated and found a yellow jug buried in the route. The ANA reported the IED and watched the IED site until the CF arrived. The QRF took over and secured the site. While exploiting the site, EOD discovered that it was a VOIED with two 18L yellow jugs buried in the route. The yellow jugs were hooked with some red det cord, but there was no pressure plate. It looked like the INS didnt have time to put the pressure plate. The EOD team continued their procedures and cleared the site. The IED was made and placed with the intent to target the CF/ANSF",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,TF K / TF East JOC Watch,ANA,ANSF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RQQ3077390317,31.52472305,65.43041229,TF East JOC Watch,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

They also had Mortar Fire walked in on their position.  Prior to this, 1/D/2-12 IN was given INTEL that there was an ambush set up while in the town.  The vehicles then conducted a bounding Overwatch while exfilling the town and traversing EA Buckeyes.  The first 2 vehicles halted and were providing an over watch for the second two vehicles when they received RPG Fire from both sides of the road.  The PL's and PSGs vehicles lost all communication due to RPG and SAF hits.  They had to relay all traffic by cell phone back to Gator 6.  Reports were very brief as D16 had uncontrollable coughing from inhaling the Halon.  Both vehicles that were hit were MRAPs.
Additionally, D16 was receiving effective and accurate mortar fire, believed to originate from vic Kilemo Village (42S XD 6585 6960).  As both elements returned fire, D16 assessed the situation and moved his elements east out of the engagement area.  Once reaching a safe distance away, calls over MBITR from the stricken vehicles noted the casualties.  Casualties were consolidated in D16s MRAP.
The lead elements second vehicle (D13) and the trail elements  lead vehicle (D16) both received direct RPG hits in the crew compartment; MRAP D13 took a direct hit from RPG on the driver side of the vehicle penetrating the crew compartment, the projectile traveling completely through (in and out) rupturing the Halon tank located near the rear passenger side seat. D13 injuries consisted of Halon inhalation.
MRAP D16, the first RPG penetrated the crew compartment from the roof on the drivers side and impacted the back window of the crew compartment on the passenger side, partially exploding inside the vehicle.  Due to this strike, 1x US SM and 1x LN Terp both sustained shrapnel to R shoulder and R leg.  Another RPG strike, and top down shot,  impacted vicinity of the gunners hatch, impacting on the inside window of the hatch, causing 2nd to 3rd degree burns to the gunners face, arms and hands.  Additionally, Halon sensors activated causing inhalation injuries.  All together, D16 counted at least 7 RPGs fired at his vehicle during the initial volley.

summary

1 X COMPLEX ATTACK (RPG AND SAF)
8 X US WIA 
2 X VEHICLE DMG 
0817:  TIC CLOSED

 S2 ASSESSMENT:
The attack was initiated as D16 approached a turn in the road. The ambush was well executed, given that the AAF were in 3 positions, 2 to the north and 1 to the South. With the Northern positions, 1 was setup close to the road and one approx 200m past it. Hitting D16 before they made the turn in the road enabled AAF to attack as D16 was likely focusing on the road watching for possible IEDs.

Summary from Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report:

(S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 210600D* Jul 09, a USPMT patrol with four vehicles left FORWARD OPERATION BASE (FOB) WALTON in order to conduct a AUP check point inspection in ARGHANDAB district.

At 1019D* while traveling NORTH on an unnamed rte at GR 41R QR 49144 07714 they found the IED buried on the center of the roadway. USPMT with AUP set up a cordon and requested assistance from the CF. QRF with CIED assets was deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS). QRF arrived on site at approx 1210D* and CIED began the exploitation. Two 18L yellow plastic jugs filled with UBE were found buried on the middle of the road with a copper wire heading WEST. The copper wire roll was left 5M WEST of the device concealed in a grape field.

Summary from Task Force Kandahar Counter - IED Tactical Exploitation Report 

Summary At 211700D*Jul 09, the QRF from FORWARD OPERATON BASE MASUM GHAR (FMG) deployed to investigate an IED site on RTE BROWN at GR 41R QQ 29678 88306, 1Km NORTH from PATROL BASE SPERWAN GHAR (PBSG). As the ANA were coming back to PBSG, they saw two FAM on the EAST side of the route. The two FAM escaped immediately to the EAST. The ANA investigated the site and found an IED. The ANA reported the IED and moved it a bit. The QRF along with CIED arrived on site at 1735D* and began exploitation. While exploiting the site, EOD assessed that the device was two improvised claymores that would be command wire initiated. The improvise claymores were hooked with red det cord. It looked like the INS didnt have time to complete the emplacement of the IED and as the command wire was hooked to the device. The two improvised claymores were hidden on the side of the road. The EOD team continued their procedures and cleared the site. The IED was made and placed with the intent to target the CF/ANSF dismounted patrols. CIED concluded their exploitation at 1852D* and returned to the FOB MSG.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
T1: AWT1 Provides Security ISO OPN Yukon Recovery
Narrative of Major Events:At 0443Z Outbreak 67/70 departed SAL to SHR and arrived at 0536Z. At 0640Z the AWT departed SHR and provided security IVO Kushamond and Nawa ISO OPN Yukon Recovery. At 0905Z the aircraft returned to SHR and assumed QRF. During post flight inspection, crew identified 1 hole in the tail rotor caused by suspected SAF.

TF Attack S2 Assessment:There has been a total of 4 SAFIREs along the West Paktika border in the last 14 days. There have been no SAFIREs in the area that supported OPN Yukon Recovery in the last 14 days.

TF THUNDER S2 Assessment: Initial reporting indicated aircraft was hit somewhere between Kushamond HLZ and Nawa HLZ, although the exact location cannot be verified.  There have been no SAFIREs in this area in the past 30 days.  The last SAFIRE (SIGNIFICANT/SAF/HIT) was near Kushamond HLZ on 12JUN09, when a Jingle Air MI-8 was hit with SAF.

42S VC 8640 9530
ISAF # 07-1998
Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:
Provide security for ground forces IVO COP Blackhawk
Narrative of Major Events:
Coming out of Blackhawk back to Shank (400-500FT AGL, 90KTS, HDG 150) during our climb up to 1000FT AGL, we observed 6-7 tracer rounds about 1/2NM out coming from the NW to the SE. EZ 43 contacted MX 46 about the tracer rounds, and about that time they had only observed 3-4 of the tracers.  EZ 42/43 had turned away from the fire when observed and continued on back to Shank.  Mexican flight returned to the suspected POO site but did not observe any further fire or any movement on the ground.  Mexican flight was approximately 1000' AGL and 110 KTS at the time of the SAFIRE.  Mexican fired 6 IR illumination rockets in support of the easy LZ landings.

TF WINGS S2 Assessment: This SAFIRE is assessed as an offensive target of opportunity SAFIRE.  Its most likely that AAF engaged the sound of the A/C and is highly unlikely that AAF could have effectively targeted A/C due to high altitude and low illum.  There have been no SAFIREs within 10NM in the last 30 days.  The last SAFIRE event to occur in Nerkh was on 19AUG08 on PEDRO 81 (HH-60G)(TF DESTINY) that was engaged with 2x RPGs during nighttime. Its assessed that AAF engaged only as a target of opportunity and is possible that engagements could increase in this area as CF increase air presence along upper HWY1 of AO SPARTAN.

The restraint wire hit a power line which cause a power outage at the PB WISHTAN. It is UNK att if the balloon crashed or if it floated away in which case it would present an airspace hazard. 

UPDATE 0602D* 
It has been observed that the balloon has not crashed IVO the PB. It is assumed that the balloon is now a hazard to the airspace. AVN (aviation) has been informed. No casualties or damage reported.

Recon was sent to investigate a possible IED IVO 41R QR 742 332.  Intel was received that a hasty IED was emplaced in a wadi and EF were going to attack CF.  Recon finished investigation withnothing to report.  They were headed back to FOB Frontenac when a CWIED detonated under the second vehicle, no injuries.  EOD was notified to conduct a PBA.  EOD arrived at 0955L and concluded that the IED was 5-6 yellow juges with UBE w/approx. NEW 120-150LBS.  The IED was placed in a culvert approx. two feet under paved surface inside a concrete culvert.  The depth of the IED directly led to the survivability of the vehicle.  The unit traced out the command wire and found a modified Minolta camera flash to provide power to the command wire.  The camera flash was left in place and EOD was requested to investigate the firing position.  After search of the firing position was completed, EOD collected the camera flash and some AA battery wrappings left at the firing position.

Friendly Mission: TF Lift(-) conducts Tag Ab Area R&S NLT 240300ZJUL09 ISO TF Korrigan/TF Warrior CIED operations.
Narrative of Major Events: BAF HUNTER TEAM I (SWT) departed BAF at approx. 0740L for a battle handover with BAF HUNTER Team II.  BHO was conducted at 0750L over Spike elements in Alasai Valley that found an IED at grid 42S WD 6445 6065 and had a suspected IED at 42S WD 6380 6045 near the Shekut school.  Team I stayed in the Alasai Valley and provided over head cover until 0900L at which point they returned to MRF for refuel.  Once back on station, SWT continued providing over head security.  At approx 1005L, as the lead aircraft approached the Shpee Valley, one RPG round passed behind the aircraft and detonated on the hillside to the north.  Trail aircraft broke off and conducted a lead change.  RPG fire was reported to COP Belda as SWT continued to develop the situation.  Lead maneuvered into the Shpee Valley and began taking machine gun fire.  Trail suppressed the POO while lead maneuvered. Another lead change was conducted.  FD 55, now lead aircraft made another pass and heard machine gun fire again but could not locate the point of origin.  At this point the SWT moved away from the area in order to attempt to acquire a target using sights, however the attempt was unsuccessful. At approx 1050L COP Belda requested the SWT clear the area so that the ANA could engage the approximate location with their DSHK. Upon post flight inspection no battle damage was found to the aircraft. 

TF EAGLE LIFT S2 ASSESSMENT: This is the first SAFIRE event to occur in the Alasai/Shpee Valley area since 28JUN09.  The fact that the aircraft were engaged twice from two different locations with two different weapon systems demonstrates the shift of AAF in Kapisa away from target of opportunity shots towards deliberate offensive engagements, particularly against SWT.  Limited activity and reporting have occurred in the Shpee Valley lately due to the in-fighting between HIG and Taliban leadership.  This engagement indicates the intent of AAF to maintain their freedom of maneuver and movement in the Shpee Valley.  This valley is a primary enemy LOC of fighters and supplies coming into Kapisa from Laghman and aircraft flying R&S missions into this valley can expect to be engaged.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose:TF Lift (-) provides aerial security and o/o CCA TF Destroyer  NLT 241200ZJUL09 IVO COP Lowell, Nuristan.
Narrative of Major Events: OD 45/46 returned to Bostick from Barge Matal in order to FARP.  Once refuel complete, OD Flight responded to TIC IVO COP Lowell at approximately 1200z.  Once on station COP Lowell and ground forces stated the AAF were engaging the aircraft at approximately 42S YE AT 1991 2135 and that COP Lowell was taking small arms, RPG, and indirect fire.  OD flight saw movement IVO grid 42S YE AT 1950 AT 1960 and the GFC cleared OD to engage.  OD flight  engaged with 2 x WP rockets and 20 x 30mm but could not reacquire any personnel.  OD Flight was then notified of another TIC in Barge Matal and exited the Kamdesh and headed north. 

TF EAGLE LIFT S2 Assessment: Due to on-going operations at Barge Matal, AAF have ample opportunities to engage aircraft transiting in the Kamdesh valley, currently considered the most dangerous valley in the NKL region for aircraft.  Expect target of opportunity SAFIREs to continue with likely points of origin from the southern ridge of the Kamdesh , concentrating in the Kamu area.  The last SAFIRE to  occur in the Kamdesh was on the AT 19JUL09 when an AWT transiting the valley en route to Barge Matal was engaged from multiple points of origin with RPG and DSHK fire. The weapons used in that engagement were well hidden to avoid detection by the AH-64s, and placed within a draw to provide concealment from CF position at COP Lowell and COP Keating.  While todays SAFIRE event was only MINOR with one point of origin engaging the aircraft with SAF, SAFIRE events in  the Kamdesh may become more lethal if AAF decide to conduct a complex attack like the one on AT 19JUL09 from both the north and south ridgelines, catching aircraft in a cross fire.

UPDATE 261134D* (FIR) 
At 250852 M12B at XP 9s western SANGER was engaged with SAF from L9J compound 52 and also from 41R PR 26050823 (mound of corn). The SANGER returned fire with GPMG. 1 x 60mm mortar was laid onto compound 52 and fired. The first round fell south of L9J c. 52, into an open field. The second round hit a bund line IVO of the same compound. They then fired a further five rounds HE onto that bund line. INS fire then ceased. No INS were seen extracting. 5 mins after the contact had stopped, 5 males (incl one casualty) approached the CP on a motorbike from the N. down the canal road. 2 of the males brought the casualty into the CP where the medic assessed and declared the casualty was dead due to 3 identified GSWs. One GSW was to the sternum, and one to both legs. No exit wounds were found. 
The LNs claimed they were farming west of L9J compound 55, 500m away from the FF point of aim. ISAF believe, from previous engagement, that they live IVO compounds 60, 61,62. 
The LNs believe the INS firing points were 41R PR 2595 0826 (northern corner of XP 9s HLS), and 41R PR 2605 0823 which is the mound of corn that ISAF engaged. Finally 25730834 (bund line). 
The LNs did not put the blame on ISAF. ISAF assess that the LNs did not want to blame the Taliban because either they were scared of potential repercussions or they were Taliban. They did however give information on the INS in the area: 
Taliban are in the areas L9J compound 57 and in the area of the antenna to the west of XP 9 IVO compound 53 L9J). They operate in a mosque to the west of L9J compound 57 (this strongly supports earlier G2). En forces travel through fields carrying shovels and use weapons they pick up from hidden caches in the fields. 
A-H of two males (pictures have been taken of these two men). 
1. ABDUL WAHEED 
2. MOHAMED WHALI 
Most likely to be insurgent fire due to the location the incident took place. FF were not engaging in the area they said the casualty caused. It is not known whether the casualty was an insurgent involved in the TiC. 
Local reaction was extremely worried and upset, but did not blame the ISAF. LNs gave information about insurgents although worried about local intimidation. FF were unsure whether the information was a come on to a booby trapped compound. BDA: No battle damage 1 x LN killed.

ISAF # 07-XXXX
Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: Big Guns 75/08 respond to reports of SVIEDs and multiple explosions IVO the Khowst Governors Compound.
Narrative of Major Events: Big Guns75/08 departed SAL at 0914Z in response to multiple audible explosions originating from the area around the Khowst Governors Compound and the Municipal Building. SWT arrived on station at 0915Z and immediately began receiving various reports from TF Steel, OCCP, and Sapper. BG observed 5-6 ANP vehicles setting up blocking positions in the area to provide security.  As the SWT moved west, the trail A/C observed a black plume approximately 800 m away from the aircraft at WB 8584 8961 (IVO the Military Hospital) and the lead aircraft felt and heard an explosion.  Both aircraft conducted evasive maneuvers and immediately witnessed indirect fire impact on FOB Salerno.  SWT moved to provide security at SAL with NSTR.      
  
TF ATTACK S2 Assessment: This SAFIRE is considered defensive target of opportunity as AAF who conducted the complex attack were most likely departing the area and observed the OH-58s. SWTs have been extremely effective when responding to attacks in the Khowst Bowl and AAF were likely attempting to dissuade OHs from remaining in the area and engaging.  Expect SAFIRE events during CCA events to continue throughout Khowst Province. This SAFIRE was the first of five events which occurred within Khowst Province on 25 JUL.  The majority of events were associated with complex attacks to which aircraft were responding at the time they were engaged.  Expect to see this level of activity continue through the 20 AUG elections.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: TF Attack provides support to Operation Yukon Recovery.
Narrative of Major Events: Risk 25/24 departed SAL in support of OPN Yukon Recovery. At 1300Z, Chalk 1 attempted to land at a NSHLZ and was engaged with 1 x round of IDF. The round impacted between Chalk 1 and 2, 200 meters from the aircraft. There was a  mile separation between both aircraft. Both aircraft did not execute the landing and awaited AWT to clear the NSHLZ. Clearance was not given and the aircraft could not identify a POO. From there, the aircraft continued mission to look for suitable NSHLZ to insert the ARF. At 1330Z, Chalk 1 attempted to insert the ARF again 300 meters outside the OBJ area. The ARF was attempting to maintain PID on 3 suspects. At this point the aircraft observed 1 x MAM step out of a qalat and engage the aircraft with SAF. The aircraft did not return fire due to assessed high CDE. There was no damage to aircraft nor injuries to crew and passengers. The aircraft continued mission with NFTR. At 1700Z the aircraft returned to Salerno. 

TF ATTACK S2 Assessment: The AAF are becoming more familiar with CF operations due to the constant AASLTs in this area. It is likely the AAF will become more brazen as missions persist ISO Yukon Recovery. This was the second of two SAFIRES which occurred during this insertion (see AH-64 Storyboard)

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: TF Attack provides support to Operation Yukon Recovery.
Narrative of Major Events: Outbreak 72/71 departed FOB Ghazni in support of OPN Yukon Recovery. At 1300Z, the team arrived at the objective area IVO VB 6243 9558. The AWT provided security for Player 05/02 as they inserted Arrow Head 21. Outbreak 72/71 provided air support for Arrow Head 21 for the next 1.5 hours. Southwest of the OBJ, the AWT observed multiple impacts of IDF, no injuries were reported. The AWT were able to locate a possible 2 man mortar team west of the OBJ which were fleeing on a motorcycle. These two individuals appeared to be transporting a tube like object. The AWT was not able to PID a weapon system, therefore they did not engage. The Risk elements attempted to insert the ARF team IOT stop the fleeing individuals but IDF, likely recoilless rifle,  landed 200 meters from their nose as they prepared to land. Following the attempted insertion, Outbreak conducted a BHO with the Mexican element. Upon egress from the OBJ area, the Risk element also reported receiving heavy machine gun fire.  At 1410Z, the AWT returned to SAL and shutdown. Upon post flight inspections,  the crew found battle damage on Outbreak 72 (Tail# 189). Pilots found 1 x round impacted the main rotor blade, and 2 x rounds impacted the fuselage. 

TF ATTACK S2 Assessment: It is likely the aircraft received SAF while providing security over the OBJ area. The AAF are becoming more familiar with CF operations due to the constant AASLTs in this area. It is likely the AAF will become more brazen as missions persist ISO Yukon Recovery. This was the second of two SAFIRES which occurred during this insertion (see UH-60 Storyboard)

ISAF # 07-XXXX
Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: Big Guns 75/08 respond to reports of SAF/RPG at Chergotah Hill and BSP 7.
Narrative of Major Events:
Big Guns 08/75 departed SAL at 1840Z ISO Timber 95 near Chergotah Hill who was receiving SAF and IDF.  SWT arrived to the south of known enemy locations and held positions until Salerno went guns cold.  While loitering in the area waiting for clear airspace, SWT observed three mortar teams engage BSP 8.  When guns from Salerno were rounds complete, Timber 95 cleared BG to engage the mortar teams at XC 0879 0360.  As they began to engage, the trail aircraft observed approximately 15-20 rounds of small arms fire directed at the lead aircraft.  SWT continued to engage areas marked by Timber 95 and conducted a total of three passes.  At that time, Timber 95 notified SWT BSP 7 was under fire and requested that BG provide support to that element.  (See BSP 7 Storyboard for details of subsequent engagement).

TF ATTACK S2 Assessment: 
This SAFIRE was the second of five events which occurred within Khowst Province on 25 JUL.  The majority of events were associated with complex attacks to which aircraft were responding at the time they were engaged.  AAF will continue to conduct complex attacks in the Khowst Bowl as this is a key area for their anti-elections campaign.  Aircraft continue to respond quickly and effectively to halt attacks against CF/ANSF and AAF appear to recognize this TTP.  During future attacks, expect AAF to establish a team dedicated to firing at aircraft when they come on station to increase the effectiveness of their attacks. Attacks against troops at BSP 7 and Chergotah Hill will continue as AAF attempt to regain control of this key logistics/supply area.  If AAF were successful in removing the ANSF/CF presence in this area, they would regain freedom of maneuver across the eastern Khowst Border.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: Aircraft conducts training within 10 NM of FOB Salerno in approved training areas.  Aircraft will conduct practice GPS approaches, pinnacle OPS (day only), EPs, live hoist at airfield, and MEDEVAC scenario training.
Narrative of Major Events: While conducting MEDEVAC APART southeast of FOB Salerno, Dustoff 40 reported receiving SAF. The crew observed 3 tracer rounds directed toward the aircraft. There was no damage reported upon post flight inspection. 

TF ATTACK S2 Assessment: This is the 3rd SAFIRE within Khowst Province in less than 24 hours.  However, this event was most likely not connected to the two that occurred during the complex attack in Khowst City or the complex attack on BSP 7/Chergotah Hill.  We assess this to be a minor target of opportunity SAFIRE, conducted by a local who was upset at aircraft conducting multiple turns and flying low over his residence.  Such attacks are relatively common near the Salerno Airfield.

Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: Big Guns 75/08 respond to SAF/RPG at  Chergotah Hill and BSP 7.
Narrative of Major Events: Immediately following a CCA/SAFIRE event at Chergotah Hill (see storyboard for additional details), Timber 95 notified Big Guns 08/75 that elements at BSP 7 was involved in a TIC.  SWT moved from Chergotah Hill to the area but received a report from TF Steel that a fire mission was being conducted against  Known Points 14 and 15 so aircraft moved to clear the airspace.  Upon completion of the fire mission, BG moved to BSP7 and observed the ground unit receive RPG rounds from their southeast.  As the aircraft climbed to gain altitude and visibility , the trail aircraft observed 8 muzzle flashes from a ridgeline IVO XC 1336 0244.  The aircraft conducted three gun runs to suppress AAF at that location with 300 rounds of .50 cal and 4 rockets. During the engagement , the trail aircraft reported taking fire at multiple times from AAF on a ridgeline at XC 1243 0347.  They responded with 75 rounds of .50 cal.  At 1930Z following the engagements, SWT was forced to return to Salerno for rearm and refuel. 

TF ATTACK S2 Assessment: This SAFIRE was the third of five events which occurred within Khowst Province on 25 JUL.  The majority of events were associated with complex attacks to which aircraft were responding at the time they were engaged.  AAF will continue to conduct complex attacks in the Khowst Bowl as this is a key area for their anti-elections campaign.

ISAF # 07-XXXX
Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: Big Guns 75/08 respond to SAF/RPG at OP Chergotah and BSP 7.
Narrative of Major Events:
At 1930Z, Big Guns 08/75 departed the BSP 7 area after conducting engagements their and at Chergotah Hill.  SWT was traveling along Route Sanders enroute to Salerno to rearm and refuel when the trail aircraft observed an RPG fired toward the lead aircraft at XC 0750 0080. The round traveled beneath the aircraft from the right side to the left and detonated approximately 500 meters to the 9 oclock position.  Neither aircraft sustained damage and the team continued to Salerno, where they assumed REDCON 3 and conducted debrief of all four SAFIREs received during their mission.  
 
TF ATTACK S2 Assessment:  
Route Sanders is the primary ground LOC to the BSP 7 area and it is likely that this AAF element was established to ambush responding ground QRF and engaged the aircraft as a target of opportunity.  This SAFIRE was the fifth of five events which occurred within Khowst Province on 25 JUL.  The majority of events were associated with complex attacks to which aircraft were responding at the time they were engaged.  AAF will continue to conduct complex attacks in the Khowst Bowl as this is a key area for their anti-elections campaign.

Summary from TFK C-IED First Look report: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 261000D* Jul 09, an AUP dismounted patrol composed of five police officer left POLICE SUB SATION (PSS) 9 in order to patrol the area of district 9. At approx 1130D* when at GR 41R QR 58309 03973 they found what they suspected was an IED inside a culvert, five meters EAST of rte MILLER LITE. The AUP set up a cordon and they requested assistance from the CF. While waiting for QRF to arrived, POMLT from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS) came to reinforce the cordon. QRF with CIED assets deployed from CNS. QRF arrived on site at approx 1236D* and CIED began the exploitation. One 4L yellow plastic jug was found with two wires going out of it and had been filled with dirt. The suspected IED was a HOAX. It is suspected that the INS emplaced this HOAX in order assessed the CF EOD TTP. It is also suspected that the INS emplaced a HOAX in order to make the AUP more confident about IED and they will strike them later as demonstrated with the events of 12 and 20 July. QRF and CIED ended his task at approx 1336D* and were back in CNS by 1345D*.

Update:  TFK C-IED First Look reports assessed IED as Hoax (See attached media.)
Summary from TFK C-IED First Look report: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At 261145D*Jul 09, US RCP found a possible IED on HIGHWAY 1 at GR 41R QQ 37733 99781, 7.5Km EAST from FOB WILSON. As the US RCP was doing a route clearance from FOB WILSON to KAF, they saw a wire coming out of a culvert on the SOUTH side of the road. The US RCP stopped their convoy and dismounted to investigate, while keeping their MCM on. When they went to investigate the ANP arrived on site and at the same time, they were engaged from the NORTH by INS. They returned fire and the FAM egress to the NORTH. The US RCP went on the suspected IED site and saw 3 yellow jug with a wire coming out the culvert and going to the SOUTH. QRF from FORWARD OPERATON BASE MASUM GHAR (FMG) deployed to investigate. CIED arrived on site at 1351D* and began exploitation. The culvert was blocked with gate on each side, but the one to the SOUTH side could be removed. EOD pulled the gate and cut the wires. Following that EOD swept the area and the surrounding compounds with the ANP. The ANP found a little house at 41R QQ 37679 99875 to the NORTH with a motorcycle battery. The ANP took it and mentioned that they would bring it to FOB WILSON. CIED went to investigate the house and took some evidences. The HOAX was 3 x empty 18L yellow jug. They were placed under the culvert, and it was hooked to nothing. It looks like the INS wanted to slow down the convoy or they wanted to observed our TTPs. The EOD team continued their procedures and confirmed that the site was cleared. The CIED concluded their exploitation at 1600D* and returned to the FOB MSG.

Update:  TFK C-IED FIRST LOOK reports that on 27July09 IED Suspected was confirmed as 1 x VOIED.  (See attached Media.) Summary from media: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 261700D* Jul 09, an ANA patrol with OMLT element left STRONG POINT (SP) SCHOOL in ARGHANDAB DISTRICT in order to do a combat patrol in their area. While doing their patrol they were engaged from the SOUTH by SMALL ARM FIRE (SAF) and they decided to return to their SP. At approx 1930D* while travelling NORTH on an unnamed rte at GR 41R QR 50255 10009 they found a suspected command wire going 30m EAST in a grape field and some disturbed ground in the center of the roadway. The ANA tried to initiate the IED with a battery but it didnt work. The ANA cut the wire and took it. At 2045D* they decided to go back to their SP in order to return on site the next morning. At approx 270600D* the patrol went back on site to confirm that the suspected IED was left on place, they set up a cordon and requested assistance from the CF. QRF with CIED assets deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS). QRF arrived on site at approx 0740D* and CIED began the exploitation. One 18L yellow plastic jug filled with UBE and a pressure plate were found buried in the center of the roadway. The suspected command wire who was heading 30m EAST in a grape field was the wire for the battery pack but no batteries were found on site. With evidence found on site, It is suspected that the INS were waiting for a target of opportunity before connecting the power source in order to avoid civilian casualties.

Friendly Mission:
TF Lift(-) and TF Attack(-) provide combat resupply and escort ISO TF YUKON OP DUSTWAN NLT 261600ZJUL09 in Paktika Province.
Narrative of Major Events:
At 1600z, Big Time and Outbreak flight of four (2xCH, 2xAH) launched from Sharana and proceeded to directly to Orgun-E by way of MSR Florida. Approximately 9km out from Orgun-E at 42S WB 10950 51940, Big Time 56 observed one RPG round pass behind the aircraft.  Following the RPG round, the sister ship CH reported tracer fire in the direction of Big Time 56 as well.  Big Time 56 conducted evasive maneuvers and continued mission.  The AWT was ahead of the Big Time flight and did not observe the SAFIRE.  Once the Big Time flight arrived safely at Orgun-E at 1620Z, the AWT proceeded back to the POO grid of the SAFIRE and reconnoitered the area with NSTR. 
   
TF Eagle Lift S2 assessment:
This SAFIRE event is assessed as an offensive target of opportunity event.  The increased air traffic in northern Paktika as a result of OP Dustwan increases the opportunities AAF have to observe aircraft flight patterns.  Numerous multi-source reports in the last 30 days indicated AAF intentions to shoot down helicopters in Paktika, most notably near Zerok COP and Margah COP. The area between Sharana and Orgun-E is not considered a high threat area for aviation operations.  However, AAF have demonstrated their willingness to engage aircraft in Paktika and flights should maintain high speeds and altitudes en route to and from Sharana.

At 1456Z, QRF and EOD exploited 2x possible IEDs, FF determined that the jugs were bait, a further 2 jugs attached to the wire detonated while the Robot was exploiting.  Minor damage was sustained to the EOD robot, the initial 2x jugs were destroyed.  Event closed at 1747Z.

Update:  TFK C-IED FIRST LOOK report attached.  1 x Hoax and 1 x F/C VOIED.  
Summary from TFK C-IED FIRST LOOK report: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 270600D* Jul 09, an AUP patrol with a vehicle and five AUP left POLICE SUB STATION (PSS) 7 in order to do a road inspection on an unnamed rte. At approx 0700D* when traveling SOUTH on the unnamed rte at GR 41R QR 52153 00758 the patrol saw two plastic jugs inside a culvert with a command wire going WEST. The patrol cut the command wire and took it. AUP set up a cordon and they requested assistance from the CF. QRF with CIED assets deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS). QRF arrived on site at approx 1034D* and CIED began the exploitation. While investigating with the ROV, EOD pull a wire and one blast occurred a meter in front of the ROV on the EAST side of the culvert. The ROV was lightly damaged, EOD was able to complete the task. The two 18L plastic jugs found under the culvert were empty and the command wire found by AUP was booby trapped. With the evidence found on site, two 4L yellow plastic jugs filedl with UBE were buried on the EAST site of the culvert to strike when a victim would pull the false command wire. When the ROV pulled on the command wire, only one jug struck because EOD had already removed the detonator from one of them. it is suspected that the INS emplaced this IED in order to target any AUP or first responders pulling the command wire on the IED. QRF and CIED end his task at approx 1222D* and were back to CNS at 1250D*. Report to follow.

The Watapor Valley has been an area that consistently  generates  kinetic activity when mounted and dismounted elements travel IVO Qatar Kala. The most recent SAFIREs in this area occurred on 17 July 09.  SWTs and AWTs conducted numerous CCAs and were engaged during an eight-hour engagement against a dismounted patrol.  The first SWT responding to the Watapor conducted numerous engagements before being engaged with a DShK, damaging the A/C. Follow on SWTs and AWTs continued with multiple engagements throughout the day. The DShK systems used during the 17 July 09 engagement have not been identified since that day.  During todays engagement the fighters utilized small arms and LMG fire, likely a PKM system.  AAF throughout Konar Province regularly initiate engagements against ground forces.  However, it is rare for cells to conduct offensive SAFIREs against scout or attack aircraft separate from engagements against ground forces, even in the Watapor Valley. Todays engagement originated from populated areas where pilots could not PID or engage the AAF.  Based on historical activity and intelligence reporting numerous AAF cells and C2 elements stage in the northern reaches of the Watapor Valley.  Consequently, this area has a high probability of SAFIRE engagements to protect these areas from detection or engagement by CF.  Incursions by aircraft north of Qowru Village, particularly near Tsangar and Gambir Villages, will very likely result in SAFIRE engagements against all types of aircraft.  While not utilized today, HMGs such as a DShK are likely to be used against aircraft to protect HVIs and safe havens.

Update:  TFK C-IED First Look Report assessed as IED Hoax  (See attached media.)

TFK C-IED First Look Report summary:(S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 280455D* Jul 09, the US RCP were doing a route clearance from FOB WILSON to KAF on HOGHWAY 1. The US RCP stopped their convoy at GR 41R QQ 37733 99781, at the culvert where a HOAX had been found 2 days ago. When they went to investigate the culvert with their camera, they saw 3 yellow jugs in the culvert. The US RCP sent their robot to confirm the 3 yellow jugs. The culvert had grates on both ends but the one on the SOUTH side was removed, just like 2 days ago when FMG QRF left the site after their exploitation. The US RCP sent a 10 liners, cordoned the area until CF QRF arrive. At 280600D*Jul 09, the QRF from FORWARD OPERATON BASE MASUM GHAR (FMG) deployed to investigate the possible IED located at 7.5Km EAST of FOB WILSON. The CIED arrived on site at 0710D* and began exploitation. While exploiting the site, EOD had difficulties to see the wires that were linking the 3 x 18L yellow jugs together. Further exploitation revealed that it was a HOAX. There was one jug filled with dirt and the two others were empty. The HOAX was made and placed with the intent to target the CF/ANSF first responders, looking to assess our TTPs or simply looking at slowing down the convoy while conducting other operations. The EOD team continued their procedures and confirmed that the site was cleared. The CIED concluded their exploitation at 0940D* and returned to the FOB MSG.
EVIDENCES: - Dirt inside the jug
- 1 x AA Battery inside a yellow jug
- Detcord orange
- 3 x yellow jug 18L
Observation: This site as been used for HOAX IED twice in the last 3 days.
Discussion: The grates are not useful anymore because of the damage that the INS did the last time.
Recommendation: The grates on the culvert should be fixed as soon as possible in order to avoid to have this incident occur once more in the next few days.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,TFK / TF South JOC Watch,TF THOR 2-2,CF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41RQQ3773399781,31.60861588,65.50593567,TF South JOC Watch,J3 ORSA,,,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

Update:  TFK C-IED FIRST LOOK report attached.  
Summary from report: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) At approx 280955D* JUL 09, the US RCP was conducting a route clearance on HIGHWAY 1 from FOB WILSON to SP HOWZ-E-MADAD, when they suspected an IED on the SOUTH side of the road at GR 41R QQ 21594 94006. The US RSP stopped their convoy and dismounted to investigate. On that same morning the ANA were conducting a route sweep on that portion of HIGHWAY 1. When the ANA arrived at the site, they were engaged from the SOUTH by INS. They returned fire but the 4 x FAM escaped to the SOUTH as an helicopter arrived at the site to provide fire support. The US RCP investigates the suspected IED and saw an improvised claymore on the SOUTH side of the road aiming towards the field. They also found a white rope running to the SOUTH and further changing for a green rope going to a possible FP. When the ANA left the site, the US RCP send a 10-liner. At 281105D*Jul 09, the QRF from FOB MASUM GHAR (FMG) deployed to investigate an IED site located at 9.7Km WEST of FOB WILSON and at 75m EAST from SP HOWZ-E-MADAD. CIED arrived on site at 1143D* and began exploitation. While exploiting the site, EOD discovered that it was a command-pull. No evidences were found at the firing point. The egress/ingress route were to the SOUTH, the way they INS escaped. The IED was a 122mm artillery shell filled with bullets and UBE used as an improvised claymore. The IED was aiming to the SOUTH, in order to target the dismounted ANA patrol. The EOD team continued their procedures and secured the site.

Summary: (S//REL ISAF, NATO) On 28 Jul 09 afternoon, an AUP patrol with six dismounted personal and one vehicle left their CHECK POINT (CP) in DISTRICT five in order to conduct a road inspection on an unnamed rte. Later in the afternoon when the patrol was traveling SOUTH on the unnamed rte at GR 41R QQ 60328 97012 they saw a suspected IED inside a culvert. The patrol set up a cordon and spent the night in position. In the morning of 29 Jul 09 they requested assistance from the CF. QRF with CIED assets deployed from CAMP NATHAN SMITH (CNS). QRF arrived on site at approx 291147D* and CIED began the exploitation. A pressure plate not connected and a 18L plastic jug filled with UBE connected to a suspected DTMF were found inside the culvert. With the evidence found on site, it appears that the pressure plate was emplaced in order to bring the first responders on site but it wasnt connected to the main charge. It is suspected that the INS emplaced this pressure plate in order to strike the first responders with the RCIED once EOD thought the device was disconnected when removing the pressure plate.

Update:  Task Force Kandahar Counter-IED Tactical Exploitation Report attached; Summary from Task Force Kandahar Counter-IED Tactical Exploitaiton Report: S//RES ISAF, OEF) At approx 290800D* July 09, a supply convoy consisting of 24 vehicles leaving from FOB RIBLEY in TARIN KHOT DISTRICT, was traveling SOUTH on RTE BEAR. At approx 1330D* they believed they struck an IED with a PLS supply truck due to an explosion heard outside of the vehicle. The vehicle was not damaged and the patrol continued to move SOUTH. Approx 150m further SOUTH, a RG-31 struck an IED at grid 42S TA 19108 54264 at approx 1335D*. The vehicle was thrown 22m SOUTH of the blast seat resulting in the vehicle being a catastrophic kill. There were 3x personnel in the vehicle wounded, the driver and co-driver being priority A and the gunner was a priority B. Immediately after striking the IED the convoy started taking heavy SAF, RPG and IDF from the mountains to the EAST and SOUTH-EAST of the road. The SAF and RPG were especially accurate and steady. During the intense SAF and RPG engagements with INS, the convoy struck another IED at grid 42S TA 18972 54177 at approx 1340D*, this being located approx 100m SOUTH of the destroyed RG-31. The vehicle was a PLS truck towing a trailer. The blast seat for this IED was located in soft sand for a by-pass lane beside a damaged bridge. Both the driver and co-driver were evacuated as priority A and the vehicle was a mobility kill. This IED strike caused the convoy to be split and separated. The convoy attempted to unhook all PLS trucks from their trailers after becoming trapped between the destroyed RG-31 and damaged PLS. They were hoping to have more mobility to attempt to by-pass the damaged PLS to get out of the kill zone. However, the PLS were not able to negotiate the soft sand and they became stuck, blocking the road completely in the kill zone. The remaining vehicles in the convoy who were further SOUTH of the first three IED strikes were not in direct contact with the INS at this time and decided to push SOUTH to get away from the kill zone. This resulted in a MRAP vehicle to strike yet another IED at grid 42S TA 18576 54177. The vehicle was a catastrophic kill and 3x crew members were evacuated with unknown priorities. The INS continued to engage the convoy for over 6 hours and many vehicles were damaged from SAF and RPG fire. A PLS truck much further SOUTH on the road was also completely burned from a reported RPG attack. A UH-60 BLACKHAWK helicopter had also burned near the IED strike site. NFI. CF EOD with CF RCP and force protection (FP) arrived on scene at approx 2100D*. Recovery of vehicles commenced immediately and continued until approx 301400D* July 09. All IED blast exploitation was completed between 300530D* July 09 and 301430D* July 09. All of the IED strikes were VOIED with pressure plates. The construction of all the pressure plates was similar and it is suspected that the same bomb maker made all of the IEDs. EOD did not exploit the first IED strike, the PLS furthest NORTH because no blast seat or damage to the vehicle could be found. EOD also did not exploit the fourth IED site, the destroyed MRAP. This was done by CF RCP elements using remote means. CF RCP with EOD left the site at approx 301530D* July and arrived in KAF at 310515D* July 09.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,TRUE,TFK / TF South JOC Watch,LTF DIRIGO,CF,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42STA1897254177,32.08895493,66.02246094,TF South JOC Watch,J3 ORSA,(ISAF) FFIR 1 FATALITY OR SERIOUS INJURY TO ISAF / USFOR-A / ESF (CAT A OR CAT B),TF South JOC Watch,ENEMY,RED,SECRET

SUPPORT07 ORBITED THE AREA SOUTH OF PEDRO15 LOCATION FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME. AT 1034Z, SUPPORT07 DEPARTED THE AREA EN ROUTE TO KAF DUE TO LOW FUEL. THE FOLLOWING DAY, DURING A PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTION, THE CREW DISCOVERED 1X BULLET HOLE IN THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE. THE CREW ASSESSED THAT THE ENGAGEMENT TOOK PLACE IN THE SAME AREA AS PEDRO15 (N3205.527 E06601.564).

 HIT, MINOR, CONFIRMED SMARMS ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON AIRCREW REPORTING AND PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTION. PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTION REVEALED 1X BULLET HOLE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SIZE OF A SMARMS ROUND. ALTHOUGH SUPPORT67 WAS NOT ISO TIC, THE A/C WAS FLYING IVO A DECLARED TIC WHERE SUPPORTING A/C WERE ALSO BEING ENGAGED. PEDRO15 WAS ENGAGED HEAVILY BY SMARMS AND POSSIBLE BF1 IN THE SAME AREA AND APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME THAT SUPPORT07 WAS PROBABLY ENGAGED. SUPPORT07 WAS ORBITING THE AREA FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME, WHICH WAS LIKELY VIEWED BY EF AS A TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY SINCE EF WERE ALREADY ENGAGING FF IN THAT AREA. ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED THAT THIS ENGAGEMENT COULD HAVE OCCURRED ELSEWHERE, THE AREAIN WHICH SUPPORT07 WAS ORBITING IS THE MOST LIKELY LOCATION OF WHERE THIS EVENT TOOK PLACE. THERE HAVE BEEN 4 SAFIRES WITHIN 10NM IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. 1 X COMBINED SMARMS/BF VS RW (1 X HIT), 1 X BF VS RW (1 X HIT), 2 X SMARMS VS RW (1 X HIT).

AUP left their location and went immediately investigate the site. At 0705D* while at GR 41R QQ 52347 99324 AUP found what they suspected was an IED on a bicycle on the WEST side of the roadway 360m EAST of a police CP. AUP set up a cordon and they requested assistance from the CF. While waiting for QRF to arrived, an AUP removed the device from the bicycle and brought the bicycle away from the IED. QRF with CIED assets deployed from CNS. QRF arrived on site at approx 0917D* and CIED began the exploitation. Two suspected DFFC with a suspected spider device were found inside a pile of hay. With the evidence found on site it is suspected that the INS emplaced this IED in order to target any CF/ANSF dismounted target of opportunity. When EOD did his procedure, the operator observed that the detonator was already detonated but the device didnt work. Furthermore the AUP of district 6 used this road everyday.

(S//REL ISAF, NATO) The unmentored ANA left MAKUAN in order to perform a road sweep on the HIGHWAY 1. On the morning of July 31st, the road sweep was conducted in a inverted-V with five dismounted ANA. At grid 41R QQ 33210 97201, the ANA found a PMN, they dug around and found a det cord and a 20L aluminum cooking pot underneath the PMN. The ANA shot on the PMN with AK-47 and the PMN detonated 3m SOUTH of the roadway. The ANA sent a 10 liner at 0730D* and the EOD from MSG arrived on site at 0921D*. The cordon was established a 100m around the IED site. On site, the EOD team recovered the 20L cooking pot filled with UBE and a det cord, the PMN was already destroyed prior to arriving on site. We disposed of the IED on site. It is assessed that the INS were trying to target dismounted patrol conducting a VPS along HIGHWAY 1. The pattern of life was normal, no suspicious activities in the area. The same IED type was exploited on July 24th 2009, at 200m in the east direction on the south side of HIGHWAY 1.

Summary of Events
SI led CF and ANSF to location. FMV was over target location via CAS.  While CAS was reported no individuals  left the area.

Isolation team reached objective and isolation was established within 2 minutes. There was no SI Lock on the objective, there were three MAMs present. Through TQ Romeo 01 was given the name, RHAMATULLAH; which correlates with the name currently being tracked for OBJ Granite Peak. The call was made that all three would be detained and brought back to FOB Salerno for HUMINT exploitation. 

HCT 08 conducted the TQ and ascertained all three were being deceptive, with one possibly being a hard-line Taliban follower. SSE on the objective was cold. 

Based off of TQ a the three MAMs have been placed in the custody of the BTIF for further exploitation.

P2: Identify AAF activity IVO historic FPs and LOCs
T3: Conduct route reconnaissance for COLD BLOOD dismounted movement from Tursan to Pirtle-King  
P3: Identify IEDs and IED emplacement teams
END STATE: COLD BLOOD conducts road assessment and KLE IVO Tursan without influence from AAF
Narrative of major events:
SWT departed JAF and refueled at Asadabad (FOB Wright). SWT Linked up with Coldblood 6 and provided area security while they looked at suspected AAF sniper house at 42S YD 2188 9340. No contact was made during the entire patrol. SWT refueled at FOB Bostic, and then returned to the south. While passing the Narang VPB, they called up and asked if we could look at the ridge to the west of the VPB for AAF fighting positions. SWT looked at the ridge to the west, as well as known positions to the south.  About 2 minutes later, at (0710Z), the VPB reported a single shot being fired from the north side of the valley believed to be directed at the SWT.  The A/C was IVO 821 471 at AGL 25ftAGL (~3800MSL), 60knts airspeed, 100deg magnetic heading.  The SWT did not observe the fire, no rounds struck the aircraft, and no damage was sustained to the aircraft. SWT departed the area and returned to JAF at 0740Z.
TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment:  The SWT was conducting area reconnaissance of an area used on 28 July 09 for an attack against the Badel VPB. On that attack a cave and suspected  DSHK hide site was subsequently engaged by a SWT resulting in three AAF KIA (unconfirmed).  The ridgeline directly north of the Badel VPB is often used for harassing engagements.  The second ridge, used as a POO for todays engagement, is likely used as a staging area as it is out of LOS of the VPB and provides access to fighting positions above the VPB.  Reporting received on 28 July 09 indicated AAF were planning an attack to overrun this post.  COP Badel sits astride AAF LOCs that support cells in the Shuryak and Korengal Valleys, and based on previous reporting was disrupting the movement of fighters and supplies.  Due to both this impact on AAF operations and the COPs position below two prominent ridgelines, this position is a prime target for sustained complex engagements.  The historical DSHK positions, while not utilized today, are within range to target A/C passing the Badel Valley on the west side of the Konar River, or A/C responding to engagements in the Badel Valley.  Todays engagement indicates AAF are wiling to conduct offensive SAFIREs against aircraft.  SWTs and AWTs should maintain standoff when conducting reconnaissance at the mouth of the Badel Valley to limit the likelihood of a SAFIRE engagement.

TF PALEHORSE S2 Assessment:
In the last two weeks there have been four CCAs in the Barge-Matal area. Primarily during the first few days following the air assault of CF into Barge-Matal on 11 JUL 09. With recent HUMINT and SIGINT intercepts of low supplies and low morale, the enemy has stated their desire to be more productive and accurate with future attacks. Today's attack originated from numerous points around the village, probably  the culmination of a preplanned attack to cause multiple CF causalities.  However, due to the estimated 20x AAF KIA, these cells will need several days to recover their losses of personnel and equipment.  CF can expect only sporadic SAF harassing attacks from the high ground surrounding Barge-Matal.  The air threat will continue to be higher in the Kamdesh Valley, particularly between COP Keating and COP Lowell.  AAF in Barge-Matal will likely continue to target attack aircraft during CCAs.

BROKE TOWARDS THE THREAT ABOUT 3 SECS AFTER THE
INITIAL ALERT, THE THROTTLES WERE SELECTED TO IDLE AND
ADDITIONAL DEFENSIVE FLARES WERE DISPENSED. DEFY64
CONTINUED TO BREAK TOWARDS THE PROJECTILE AND
DESCEND, WITH THE PILOT KEEPING TALLY THROUGHOUT. THE

THINNING AND STRAIGHTENING OUT AS IT APPEARED TO
GUIDE TOWARDS THE AIRCRAFTS 6 OCLOCK. DEFY64 WARNED
DEFY63 OF THE THREAT AND INSTRUCTED THEM TO FLARE.
UPON EXITING THE THREAT AREA, DEFY64 BEGAN A CLIMB AND
INFORMED THE CRC (CROWBAR) THAT THEY HAD DESCENDED
THROUGH THE BLOCK OF THE HAWG (A-10) FORMATION
OPERATING BELOW THEM AND REQUESTED THAT THE
FORMATION BE MADE AWARE OF THE THREAT. DEFY63
RESPONDED TO DEFY64S RADIO TRANSMISSION BY AGGRESSIVELY OVERBANKING THE A/C AND DISPENSING
FLARES, UNSURE OF THE POO AS THE A/C WAS POSITIONED
TOWARDS AN UNPOPULATED AREA. ONCE THE THREAT WAS
ASSESSED TO HAVE BEEN NEGATED, BOTH A/C CLIMBED BACK
INTO THEIR BLOCKS AND HELD APPROXIMATELY 15NM FROM
POO. THE CREW ASSESSED THAT THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT
LASTED 15 SECS AND THEY EXITED TO THE WEST TOWARDS
AN UNPOPULATED AREA, AWARE OF THE PROBABLE POO (IN A
SECTION OF IRRIGATED FIELDS). AT THIS TIME, BOTH CREW IN
DEFY64 OBSERVED THE DISSIPATING COILED SMOKE TRAIL
ALMOST CO-ALT, ON THEIR RIGHT-HAND SIDE AS THEY EXITED
THE AREA. DEFY63 CONTACTED WIDOW43 (JTAC) TO INFORM

Comments: CLOSE, MINOR, PROBABLE SMARMS ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON AIRCREW OBSERVATION AND REPORTING. THE COLOR OF THE TRACER ROUNDS IS CONSISTENT WITH SMARMS. REPENT FLT WAS LIKELY A TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY SINCE THE A/C WAS CONDUCTING BDA OVER A KNOWN EF LOCATION. REPENT FLT CONDUCTED MULTIPLE PASSES OVER THE AREA, WHICH LIKELY INCREASED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EF TO EFFECTIVELY DETECT AND TARGET THE A/C. EF WERE LIKELY FIRING AT THE SOUND OF THE A/C BECAUSE OF LOW ILLUMINATION AND THE ALTITUDE AT WHICH REPENT ELEMENTS WERE FLYING. EF IN THE GARMSIR REGION HAVE REACTED AGGRESSIVELY TO INCREASED CF PRESENCE IN THE AREA EVER SINCE OP KHANJARI BEGAN IN EARLY JULY. RW ASSETS WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO BE TARGETED AS EF TRY AND PREVENT CF SUCCESS IN THIS AREA. FROM THE ATTACHED GRAPHIC,THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF SAFIRE ENGAGEMENTS IN THAT AREA WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED WITH USMC OPS IN THE GREEN ZONE REGION ISO OP KHANJARI. THERE HAVE BEEN 8 SAFIRES W/I 10NM IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. 2 X RPG VS RW (NO HIT), 5 X SMARMS VS RW (2 X HITS), 1 X COMBINED SMARMS/RPG (NO HIT)

  DISTANT, MINOR, POSSIBLE BELT-FED INFORMATION PROVIDED IS CONSISTENT WITH A BELT-FED WEAPON. BASED ON CREW OBSERVATIONS THE BURN OUT ALTITUDE IS GREATER THAN THAT OBSERVED WITH SMARMS. THIS EVENT IS LIKELY A TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY IN AN ATTEMPT TO HARASS AN A/C ON DEPARTURE FROM KAF. ALTHOUGH A LARGER CALIBER WEAPON MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN THIS ENGAGEMENT DUE TO THE HIGH BURN OUT ALTITUDE AND TOTAL DISTANCE OF OBSERVED TRAVEL, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS WAS A PRE-PLANNED ENGAGEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EF TARGETED THE A/C BY ITS SOUND. THIS IS AN INDICATION OF A LACK OF PREPARATION AND EF LIKELY DEPARTED THE AREA AFTER THE EVENT. THE SHORT BURST MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO A FRUSTRATION THAT THEY COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY TARGET THE AIRCRAFT, HAVE LIMITED AMMUNITION OR THE WEAPON SYSTEM JAMMED, PREVENTING THEM FROM CORRECTING FIRE ON THE DEPARTING AIRCRAFT.A CF RW ASSET HAD RECENTLY DEPARTED KAF AND NOTED A SIMILAR INCIDENT, HOWEVER, THE CREW ASSESSED THE EVENT AS CELEBRATORY FIRE. WHILE THIS DOES NOT DISCOUNT THE EVENT, IT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN PUTTING THIS ATTACK INTO PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS A DELIBERATE, PREPLANNED ATTACK. IF IT WERE WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE FP AND A MIXTURE OF WEAPON SYSTEMS WHICH ARE MISSING IN THIS EVENT. AIRCREWS NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THIS EF COA. EF DO NOT SEEM TO FOLLOW THIS COA NEAR LARGE CF LOCATIONS, PROBABLY DUE TO THE EFFECTIVE FORCE PROTECTION MEASURES IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS WHICH PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE EFFECTIVE. AIRCRAFT ON DEPARTURE USUALLY INCREASE BOTH HEIGHT AND SPEED AND WHICH MAKES THE GUNNERS FIRING SOLUTION INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND MAY BE A REASON FOR THE ROUNDS FALLING BEHIND AND LOW OF THE AIRCRAFT.
