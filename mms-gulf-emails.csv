SPECIAL INFORMATION
January 2009

Descriptions of Geological and Geophysical Activities
Regulatory authority for geological and geophysical (G&G) surveys are authorized by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCS Lands Act) ; (Title 43, Chapter 29, Subchapter III, ? 1340); 30 CFR 250 Subpart B (onlease); 30 CFR 251(exploration); and 30 CFR 280 (minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur). The following are descriptions of potential G&G activities associated with oil and gas, as well as non-mineral resources (sand and gravel), and alternative energy activities. These activities include the various G&G exploration techniques currently being used in other areas and expected to be employed in the future by operators in the Atlantic OCS. Particular attention is paid to seismic techniques, especially the role of seismic sources (e.g., airguns). Seismic surveys have historically covered large areas of the OCS each year and have the potential for ""significant"" impacts on the environment, unless mitigation and monitoring measures to reduce or eliminate impacts to the environment are applied. Further, there are increasing concerns in the regulatory and scientific communities regarding acoustic impacts on marine life, including marine mammals, turtles, and fishes. Therefore, seismic surveys are described first, followed by the other techniques.

High-Resolution Seismic Data. High-resolution site surveys collect data using electrically generated acoustic sources from 140 to 210 decibels (dB) that are reflected from sediments near the seafloor surface to several kilometers or more below the seafloor. They are used for various reasons - to investigate potential geohazards and soil conditions, to identify potential benthic biological communities (or habitats) and archaeological resources, or to a lesser degree for exploration purposes. Such high-resolution data may be used for initial site evaluation for drilling rig emplacement and for platform or pipeline design and emplacement. They can also be used for the identification of potential sand resources for coastal restoration. High-resolution site survey data obtained at greater depths below the seafloor can be used for exploration purposes. Deep-Penetration Seismic Surveys. Deep-penetration seismic exploration and development surveys are conducted to obtain data on geological formations from the sediment near-surface to several thousand meters deep (below the sediment surface). A survey vessel will tow a lowfrequency acoustic source (usually high-pressure airgun arrays) that penetrates several thousand feet in the earth's subsurface and are then refracted to surface receivers, either towed in the water column or placed on the ocean bottom. These acoustic sources are generated by airguns, generating compressed air bubbles, and are generally in the 225- to 260-dB range for airgun arrays. This information enables industry to accurately assess potential hydrocarbon reservoirs and helps to optimally locate exploration and development wells, maximizing extraction and production from a reservoir. In two-dimensional or three-dimensional seismic surveys, the receivers (hydrophones) are on streamer cables towed behind the survey vessel at a depth of 5 to

10 meters (m) below the surface of the water. Individual streamers can be up to 12 kilometers (km) in length or, on rare occasions, even longer. Tail buoys with radar reflectors and strobe lights are used to mark the end of the streamers and make them more visible and/or detectable to other vessels. Alternatively, receivers may be deployed on the seafloor as bottom cable surveys or remotely-operated vehicle positioned ""nodes."" When conventional 3D ship surveys or bottom cable surveys are repeated at the same location over time, these are referred to as 4D or timelapse surveys. Another method of determining downhole seismic through the wellbore involves vertical cables with receivers suspended within wellbores and an external source used in the water column, usually by another vessel or a source hung over the rig.

Deep-Tow, Sidescan-Sonar Surveys. Deep-tow, sidescan-sonar surveys are conducted in the Gulf of Mexico primarily for engineering studies involving the placement of production facilities and pipelines. These surveys provide information on the presence of sand flows, hydrates, and seeps, as well as bottom topography (e.g., hard bottom).
Operations are conducted from ships towing cables up to 7 km long, which enables operations in water depths up to 3,000 m deep. Close to the end of the cable is a 30- to 45-m long section of chain to keep the sensor package (fish) tracking at approximately 25-30 m above the bottom. To do this requires the chain to be dragged along the seafloor, causing an approximately 10 centimeter (cm) wide by 15 cm deep (4 inch wide by 6 inch deep) trench to be cut in the seafloor. In situations where the chain can become entangled in shipwrecks, well heads, or other obstructions or where reef colonies live, the chain is removed, and the sensor package is kept above the seafloor by adjusting the length of the tow cable. Maintaining a constant elevation above the seafloor by adjusting the cable length is very difficult, and the elevation above the seafloor is somewhat greater in this case.

Electromagnetic Surveys. Electromagnetic surveys are used to help delineate potential oil and gas reservoirs. Many geological processes in the crust and upper mantle of the seafloor involve the interaction of fluid phases with surrounding rock. The conductivities of hydrothermal phases are different from those of host rock, and collectively they offer distinct profiles of electrical conductivity/resistivity depending on the specific geological process involved. Magnetotelluric surveys are passive measurement of the earth's electromagnetic fields. Additionally, controlled source electromagnetic surveys, sometimes referred to as seabed logging, induce very lowfrequency (typically less than 2 hertz) electromagnetic signals into the upper layers of the seafloor via a towed dipole. The signals are propagated laterally to an array of receivers kilometers away. The variations in the electromagnetic field relative to the geometry of the receiver arrays and distance provide a conductivity/resistivity profile of the seafloor. From the profile, hydrocarbon reservoirs can be differentiated from water reservoirs and surrounding rock. Geological and Geochemical Sampling. Geological and geochemical sampling is conducted to obtain samples of the seafloor for physical and/or chemical analyses. Physical analyses are used in engineering studies for the placement of structures such as platforms and pipelines. Chemical analyses (surface geochemical prospecting) are based on the premise that upward migrated petroleum from deep source rocks and reservoirs can be detected in near-surface sediments and are used to evaluate exploration potentia1.

Bottom sampling involves devices that penetrate only a few centimeters to several meters below the seafloor. Samples of near surface sediments are typically obtained by dropping a piston core or gravity core (""dart""), essentially a weighted tube, to the ocean floor and recovering it with an attached wire line. Samples can also be obtained using a grab, which is a device with a jaw-like mechanism, or with a dredge, which is a wire cage dragged along the seafloor. Shallow coring is done by conventional rotary drilling equipment from a drilling barge or boat. Penetration is usually limited to the recovery of several feet of consolidated rock. Usually, a program of bottom sampling and shallow coring is conducted simultaneously using a small marine drilling vessel. Surface geochemical prospecting is a petroleum exploration technique based on the premise that upward migrated petroleum from deep source rocks and reservoirs can be detected in nearsurface sediments and used to evaluate exploration potentiaL In deepwater exploration, a crucial and arguably the most critical single issue is whether oil has been generated and, if it has, what can be determined, before making costly decisions, regarding the quality, maturity, and age of the source succession. Fortunately, since oil and gas accumulations are invariably leaky, surface geochemical exploration can be used to recover and type migrant hydrocarbons in the initial exploration phases.

Remote Sensing. Radar imaging is currently used to detect oil slicks on the sea surface. This is possible because, when the oil molecules reach the sea surface, they form a thin layer that dampens the ocean surface capillary waves. The detection of oil slicks requires quiet water conditions and consequently is limited by sea state as well as by satellite position and frequency of coverage. Aeromagnetic Surveys. Aeromagnetic surveys are conducted in the Gulf of Mexico to look for deep crustal structure, salt-related structure, and intrasedimentary anomalies. The surveys are flown by twin-engine, fixed-wing aircraft, typically Cessna 404 or 208, Piper Aerostar, or Navajos. The flight lines are on the order of 400 km long, are at a height of 75-150 m above the surface, and are flown at speeds of about 220 kmlhoUf. Gravity Surveys. Marine gravity data can be collected with instruments on the seafloor, in boreholes, in ships, or in helicopters. Data were originally collected on the seafloor, but modem technology has moved the collection point to ships. Marine gravity meters have, in some cases, been housed in a ship while it is conducting a seismic survey. However, the preferred method has been to use dedicated ships (about 50 m long) in order to acquire more precise data. With the advent of global positioning systems navigation systems and larger, more stable seismic ships, it is now possible to achieve the same order of accuracy with meters placed in seismic ships as in dedicated ships. Data grids for gravity surveys range from 1.6 km by 8 km to 9.7 km by 32 km. Marine Magnetic Surveys. Marine magnetic surveys measure the earth's magnetic field for the purpose of determining structure and sedimentary properties of subsurface horizons. These surveys are usually conducted in conjunction with a seismic survey, allowing the navigation information to be used for both surveys. The development of low-power digital sensors has allowed the sensor package to be towed behind the seismic source array, which has greatly improved the operational efficiency of magnetic surveys.

Companies have done extensive 2-D seismic in the Gulf and are continuing do so; 3-,D has not rendered 2-D surveys obsolete. The reason for that is that companies can acquire 2-D survey much quicker than a 3-D survey; 2-D provides a difference in geographic orientations (i.e., 3-D is traditionally N/S - EIW versus 2-D can be reconfigured to go NE/SW). Plus the 2-D survey can cover a much larger area in a shorter period of time and is much less expensive. ""2-Dimensional"" or ""2D"" works in defining this type of survey; ""long-record length"" isn't necessary.

Thanks very much, Lyn! This is extremely helpful. But, .naturally, leads to another request - could we get Table 5 and the spreadsheet you just sent for the UTRR in the leased areas? So, basically, I'm just asking how much of the UTRR in the 6 leaseable planning areas is leased, and how much is unleased. And could we also get new figures for the attached table, which is for the 2007-2012 plan, but using the 2010-2015 OPP? Let me know if that request was a little unclear. Thanks, --Steve

MMS Response to DPP Questions:

On page 7, it says that ""the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars."" Steve didn't see that number split out anywhere in the report (after flipping through to the end), so could MMS break that down ... how much of that is taxes, and how much is profits?
Answer: The sum of Federal corporate taxes and corporate net income generated by the new program is forecasted to be $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 million in present value dollars. The break-down of these measures is, for the nominal dollar case, approximately $400 billion in taxes and $700 billion in net profits. In the present value dollar case, MMS estimates about $50 billion is in taxes and $80 billion in corporate profits.

On page 23, there's a reference to the 1997 MMS cumulative effects report, which is a fulfillment of the OCSLA Section 20(e) requirement that MMS report to Congress on cumulative effects every three years. Have there been more recent cumulative effects reports, and if not, why not?
Answer: The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66), Section 3003 terminated the requirement of submittal of the Report on Effects of Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Activities on Human, Marine, and Coastal Environments under section 20(e) of the OCS Lands Act (see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104 cong public laws&docid=f:pubI66.104.pdf). The last report required by OCSLA Section 20(e) was published in 1997 and was entitled Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Natural Gas Resource Management Program: Cumulative Effects 1992-1994, OCS Report MMS 97-0027 . You may download a copy of the report at http://www.mms.gov/itd/hdqrspubs.htm.

Page 3 of 3

On page 25, it mentions a lawsuit against the 2007 5-year plan. Could we get copies of the filings to date and information on status of that lawsuit?
Answer: Solicitor's Office is providing copies and the documents will be delivered to you by February 20.

On page 78, there's a reference to the report, ""Energy Alternatives and the Environment"". The link to this report on the 2007-2012 5-yr program page apparently is broken. Can we get him an electronic copy of that report?
Answer: The link has been fixed on mms.gov. Electronic file attached.

Can we get a map with indications of the distance from the FL coast of the various parts of that DPP area (both the area with proposed full leasing and the area that has the no permanent structure buffer)?
Answer: See attached maps in two formats with contour lines at 25-mile intervals.

On page 90; Table 5 - presents resource estimates by PA for all ""unleased, undiscovered, economically recoverable resources."" Can we provide the UERR for the ""leased"" resources?
Answer: Excel spreadsheet attached.

On page 93/94; the DPP talks about the OECM model for estimating environmental and social costs associated with OCS activities. Can we provide the data ""inputs""?
Answer: The inputs to the model are Exploration and Development (E&D) scenarios and Production Profiles prepared inhouse. MMS considers this information as privileged.

Can we provide information on the recent contract for the Mid-Atlantic study?
Answer: This study consists of a data search and synthesis of existing environmental and socioeconomic information for the northern and central Atlantic area. An evaluation will be made of the relative contributions of physical oceanographic processes to crossshelf transport, as well as the contributions of buoyancy and meteorological forcing to seawater transport. We expect the report to be completed in late 2009. For more information you can go to the website at http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/re.9ulate/environ/ongoin9 studies/gm/GM-07Q2__html

Hi Lyn, You sent us the attached spreadsheet a few weeks ago, and I just wanted to check on a few things. The UTRR numbers are a bit different than the 2006 Assessment - the spreadsheet shows a total of 85.26 billion barrels of UTRR, while the 2006 assessment shows 85.88 billion barrels, which is a minor difference I'm not too concerned about (although I am interested in knowing if these numbers are updated UTRR numbers that supersede what's in the 2006 Assessment) . But the big difference is in the UERR, which was 65.61 billion barrels at $60/bbl in the 2006 Assessment, but in the spreadsheets is 52.1 billion barrels at the same price. Is that a reflection of increased commodity costs (steel, etc.), or is there something else behind it? Thanks, --Steve

Steve - In response to your January 21 email inquiries regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report: 1. The report mentioned that it was an every-ather-year thing, but Steve believes he has seen interim reports in the other years. (Have there been interim reports?) Will there be an update to the data in this report coming out this year? The deepwater report is published every-other year (see following). While we are not aware of any interim reports, there is deepwater information that is generated as needed. This is reflected on MMS's Deepwater webpage: http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/offshore/deru:>wtr.htmi.

2. What is the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? No. Drillship availability was being pushed into hurricane season so the cruise was delayed until spring 2009 to maximize the chance for a successful endeavor.
3. Was there any criteria used to define SP, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? This is described on page 14 as ""In this report, we define major companies to include SP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and Shell. The grouping of these four entities does not indicate a regulatory conclusion or an analysis of production size. It is merely a convenient category for the purpose of comparison."" These larger companies, with greater resources to draw on, tend to focus on larger resources that may take greater capital to develop than smaller independents can consider. This distinction simply makes a convenient way to capture the differences in company philosophy that tends to be seen in bidding patterns.

4. On page 20, there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250 . Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? Companies do not have to give a reason for forfeiting the 1/5th payment on their bonus bid. Typically, a forfeiture is based on a company acquiring new information after they have placed their bid . If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally

determined, the company can choose to limit their loss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale. 5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requ ires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible . 6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement document found at httQj/www.mms.gov/revaldiv/PDFs/FinallnvRQtToCQ_ngress0501 06.Qdf. 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so.

18 February 2009 Secretary Ken Salazar U.S. Department of the Interior 1849 C. Street NW Washington, DC 20240 Dear Secretary Salazar: We represent six Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states pursuing offshore wind energy development to address our need for clean, renewable sources of energy for the generation of electricity. As th you highlighted in outlining your Offshore Energy Strategy on February 10 , the offshore wind resource off the east coast is our most abundant local source of renewable energy. We have, as individual states, taken assertive action to plan for, support and attract wind development in state and adjacent federal waters by engaging in ocean planning, with renewable energy as a centerpiece-issue, andlor partnering with developers to site projects . We are encouraged by your commitment to moving forward with renewable energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), and we look forward to working in partnership with your staff at the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to rapidly implement an efficient and rational program. In anticipation of the imminent release of the Final Rule for Alternative Energy Leasing on the OCS we request the establishment of a formal New England-Mid Atlantic States Joint Planning Agreement with MMS. This effort would not negate the need for individual state or sub-regional communication with MMS, to address states' specific situations and timeframes; however, we feel there is a critical collective agenda that will best be addressed by east coast states and MMS working together. Our goals are: o To develop a consistent, efficient approach to integrating state-federal activities, including resource assessment and data collection; o To develop a mechanism for addressing regional needs and issues in state-based planning initiatives; o To consider the interface between state planning and federal lease-sale activities; To create an intergovernmental forum to address issues specific to offshore wind energy o leasing. Section 388 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which gives MMS the responsibility to establish an Alternative Energy Program on the OCS, includes the requirement to ""ensure consultation with state and local governments, federal agencies, and other stakeholders."" A joint planning agreement with those states most actively engaged in promoting offshore wind development along their coasts is clearly a cost effective and efficient means to meet this requirement.

Representatives from the energy and/or environmental agencies in our states have been conferring with the US Offshore Wind Collaborative (USOWC) 1 and the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA) over the past several months and have determined that cooperative engagement among the states, and between the states and federal agency partners - is essential to meeting our urgent renewable energy, environmental and economic development objectives, through the sustainable development of the wind resources along our coastlines. We welcome the participation of other states in this initiative as their offshore wind agendas advance. We believe that there is an urgent, immediate need to establish this state/MMSpartnership. Our states have ambitious renewable targets and offshore wind is one of the most promising resources available in this region to achieve these mandated state standards. Our states will be hampered in advancing the responsible siting of offshore wind projects to ensure compliance with state renewable policies if there is delay in establishing an effective partnership mechanism to coordinate state and federal offshore wind energy activities. At this juncture, we suggest a meeting with MMS, representatives from participating states, the USOWC and CESA to discuss the logistics of establishing a Memorandum of Agreement and a scope of work for a Northeast-Mid-Atlantic Offshore Wind Working Group. Please contact Fara Courtney, representing the USOWC, to facilitate scheduling of the meeting or such other course as MMS might propose. We appreciate the diligent work of MMS staff in creating a new regulatory structure for offshore renewable energy development, and we look forward to forging a formal partnership to rapidly and successfully implement the program. Sincerely,

_ _

Ms. Nancy Sutley, Chairwoman Council on Environmental Quality 722 Jackson Place NW Washington, D.C. 20503 Dear Ms. Sutley,
On behalf of the states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, we are pleased to infonn you of an effort to develop an interstate agreement on ocean and coastal management in the Mid-Atlantic region. As a native New Yorker, you have personally experienced the strong connection between the people of the Mid-Atlantic states and our ocean and coastal resources. Our region is defmed as much by a productive and diverse marine environment as it is by the presence of large cities and urban areas. Because we share these resources with one another, the challenges facing them affect each of our states in similar ways. We therefore have directed our staffs to develop a fonnal agreement which will commit us to addressing priority ocean issues within the region, such as energy development, climate change, water quality, and habitat protection.

We believe that two key elements are necessary to make this effort successful. First, the approach that we are embracing must acknowledge the severity of the challenges faced by our ocean ecosystems, and must address the important role of humans within those systems. We intend to develop an agenda that will promote significant, achievable improvements to our collective management of ocean and coastal resources. Second, and equally important, we will need the full and continued support of our partners as we develop and implement our agenda. To that end, we are planning to engage in a robust public process that will include soliciting input from the business, academic, and non-governmental communities. The Mid-Atlantic will be the first region to commit to a regional approach to ocean management during President Obama's Administration. We believe that this presents you and your federal colleagues with a significant opportunity to demonstrate the President's commitment to regional collaborative efforts. As a first step toward that commitment, we are requesting that the federal government designate a lead, or co-leads, to provide direct support as we identify the most appropriate and effective opportunities for partnership in a regional context.

We also would like to notify you of our intention to convene a Mid-Atlantic Ocean Summit in New York City this coming May. This day-long event will bring together the key officials from our respective states for a meaningful discussion on advancing our regional agenda. The issues we have identified wiU provide opportunities for a substantial federal role, and we strongly encourage your participation. More information will be provided as event planning advances. We look ahead with great anticipation to a productive and collegial relationship with you, and hope that this regional effort is the first of many successful partnerships with the new Administration.

Sincerely,

David A. Paterson Governor of New York

Subject: RE: Regional OCS planning councils

Thanks Steve, I'll check schedules. Can we say 2:00 on the 30 th ? On another topic , on Tuesday, you, Deborah, and John Goll got into a discussion on older seismic data. John indicated that for AK, there may be some ability to reprocess older data .. .only in certain places, depending on the target. For example, the belief is that North Aleutian Basin data could be used for lease sale decisions -reprocessed . Companies would still want to shoot new 3D data before drilling a well. You asked if the same were true for the Atlantic. The following is our response: Companies are currently assessing the best method for looking at Atlantic resource potential. This includes reprocessing existing data and collecting new data. There seems to be a tendency to look at the old data as being either too old to be useful or covering a considerable amount of area so why would any more be needed. The old data provides a considerable amount of knowledge about the Atlantic geology and provided the basis for an active leasing program in the 1970's and early 80's. Reprocessing could provide more detailed information and is likely to be useful in some areas. Reprocessing, however is not cheap and will run into some limits based on the original data (e.g. depth of recording, length and quality of hydrophone streamer (the underwater microphones], and size and tuning of the sound source) . Collecting new 2-D data is more expensive but can overcome these shortcomings. It is important to note that some reprocessing improvement is based on information collected during well drilling. Reprocessing existing data, collecting new 2-D and 3-D data will improve our assessment results but even in the Gulf of Mexico where we have thousands of wells and exceptional seismic coverage, there is still some uncertainty in our resource assessment. Thanks, Cheri

Hi Cheri, March 30 th would be fine, as long as it's in the afternoon. And the extra week is probably better since we are going to want to discuss all the partnerships, so that'll involve roping in extra people. Thanks! --Steve

Hi Steve, Unfortunately I will be in the GOM next week for a series of meetings. If you want it next week, Wed would be best (if the AE guy is available), and I can coordinate before I leave on Monday. Having said that, would the 30 th be too late? Would give me a better opportunity to get on folks calendars. Do you want to discuss all of the partnerships I've sent you info on, or just the renewables? If the former, I will need to patch in our Pacific Region Cheri

Steve, Two more examples of Regional partnerships in which MMS is an active player (1) the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, http://www.gulfofmexicoaliiance.orgL. Specific mention of MMS as an active partner can be found in documents

Page 2 of3
such as http://www.gulfofmexicoalliance.org/pdfs/fwg 081108.pdf, among others. And (2) the Northeast Regional Ocean Council, http://community.csc.noaa.gov/nroc/index.php. Since Deborah mentioned the BLM collaboration for renewables in Wyoming (REZ??), we also want to make you aware of our Renewable Energy program collaborations, from brand new to in place. Our AE website is loaded with regional, state, task forces, workshops, outreach efforts, and so on that we are involved with. http://www..mms.gov/otfshore/AlternativeEnergy/StakeholderWorkingGroups.htm http://www.mms.gov/offshore/AlternativeEnergyf2009CalendarofEvents.htm In addition I would point to two specifics, the first not on the site yet as we just learned about it. The Mid-Atlantic Regional Ocean Planning Group (attached is a PDF - Governors' Letter and May Summit Announcement). MMS plans to attend the May Summit.

Attachments: UERR and UTRR - leased and unleased by planning area.xls
Hi Steve, See answers to your questions regarding the attached spreadsheet in green font below. Our analyst in the Gulf who had been assigned the two remaining questions you had regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report has been occupied with the Secretary's 45-day report. I will check on the status. Thanks, Cheri From: Feldgus, Steve [mailto:Steve.Feldgus@mail.house.gov] Sent: Tuesday, March 10, 20095:53 PM To: Herdt, Lyn Subject: Question about attached sheet
Hi Lyn, You sent us the attached spreadsheet a few weeks ago, and I just wanted to check on a few things. The UTRR numbers are a bit different than the 2006 Assessment - the spreadsheet shows a total of 85.26 billion barrels of UTRR, while the 2006 assessment shows 85.88 billion barrels, which is a minor difference I'm not too concerned about (although I am interested in knowing if these numbers are updated UTRR numbers that supersede what's in the 2006 Assessment).

MMS Response: These numbers are not updated (or superseded) UTRR numbers from the 2006 Assessment. The difference between the Total of 85.26 Billion bbls oil UTRR on the attached spreadsheet and the 85.88 Billion bbls oil from the assessment lies in the Alaska DeS areas of negligible potential that were not reported in the DPP (or on the attached spreadsheet). The areas that make up the difference are: Hope (.1SBbbls oil), Norton (.06 Bbbls oil), Navarin (.13 Bbbls oil), St. George Basin (.21 Bbbls ai/), Shumagin (,01 Bbbls ai/), and Kodiak (.05 Bbbls oil).
But the big difference is in the UERR, which was 65.61 billion barrels at $60/bbl in the 2006 Assessment, but in the spreadsheets is 52.1 billion barrels at the same price. Is that a reflection of increased commodity costs (steel, etc.), or is there something else behind it?

MMS Response: Yes, as you mention cost increases have had a significant impact on UERR's especially in Alaska. Several significant updates to the economic assumptions were made for the 2008 economic assessment. The most influential change involved the adjustment of costs according to oil prices, where costs follow price trends. This fundamental relationship was not modeled in previous MMS assessments, so economic resource potential was generally over-estimated at high prices and under-estimated at low prices. For the 2008 economic assessment, costs were updated to a higher base price and then adjustments to costs with increasing oil prices were made automatically in a recently improved version of our assessment model (GRASP). In addition to development and drilling cost increases, gas processing and transportation costs were other important cost updates. These costs are typically input as gas tariffs (Mct) and do not have an automatic cost-price adjustment in the GRASP model. For Arctic provinces, the gas transportation tariff was increased (+$1 .601 Mcf) to reflect the increase in costs for a future gas pipeline. LNG facilities for gas exports were increased by $1. OOIMcf to reflect current costs for new facilities in remote areas as well as for new Jones-Act ships. Also, the value of gas production decreased because of the current assumption regarding the gas price btu-discount. In the 2006 assessment, a $60 oil price was correlated to a gas price of $9.07IMcf. In 2008, a $60 oil price is associated with a $6.41 gas price. Thus, gas value decreased by 30% while processing and transportation costs increased to reflect present conditions. This affected the economic simulations for both gas and oil prospects. Gas prospects

that were marginal in the 2006 assessment became uneconomic in the current assessment, and the value of oil prospects were negatively affected when oil and gas are co-developed.
The data is presented as being ""as of July 2010"". Does that mean that the numbers in there do not reflect the current situation?

MMS Response: No, the ""as of July 2010"" statement means that the leased and unleased portions of the UTRR's are estimated to reflect what would be available for lease at the start of the new program (July 2010). As you know, this date has now slipped but that will not have a significant impact on the leased and unleased numbers. .

Attachments: 1996-2007LeasingHistory.pdf; Fig56-DeepWaterReport-SupportingData.xls; FW: 1-21-09 Request: Set of questions regarding 2008 Deepwater GOM report
Steve, In response to your email of March 11,2009 (third attachment), we have attached information to answer questions number 5 and 7. Cheri

5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)?
(See attached file ""1996-2007LeasingHistory.pdf""). This contains tables showing leases by year leased, year re-leased , and water depth as well as graphs depicting the lease history. The focus is on leases that were leased a second time however, there were a few leases that were re-leased for a third time. Since these were fairly small numbers, these were not shown by water depth. It would be a fair assumption that most of these re-leased for a third time tended to be shallow water. In more recent years, the blocks that have been re-Ieased tend to be the shallow-water blocks. This is related to the primary terms for shallowwater blocks being 5 years and for deepwater blocks being 10 years.

7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM?
(See attached file ""Fig56-DeepWaterReport-SupportingData.xls""). This file contains the data that were used to generate Figure 56 in the Deepwater Report.

Steve - In response to your January 21 email inquiries regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report:
1. The report mentioned that it was an every-other-year thing, but Steve believes he has

seen interim reports in the other years. (Have there been interim reports?) Will there be an update to the data in this report coming out this year? The deepwater report is published every-other year (see following). While we are not aware of any interim reports, there is deepwater information that is generated as needed. This is reflected on MMS's Deepwater webpage: http://www.gomr.mIllMov/homepg/offshore/deepwtr.html.

2. What is the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? No. Drillship availability was being pushed into hurricane season so the cruise was delayed until spring 2009 to maximize the chance for a successful endeavor.
3. Was there any criteria used to define BP, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? This is described on page 14 as ""In this report, we define major companies to include BP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and Shell. The grouping of these four entities does not indicate a regulatory conclusion or an analysis of production size. It is merely a convenient category for the purpose of comparison."" These larger companies, with greater resources to draw on, tend to focus on larger resources that may take greater capital to develop than smaller independents can consider. This distinction simply makes a convenient way to capture the differences in company philosophy that tends to be seen in bidding patterns.

4. On page 20, there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250. Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? Companies do not have to give a reason for forfeiting the 1/5th payment on their bonus bid. Typically, a forfeiture is based on a company acquiring new information after they have placed their bid. If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally

10/5/2010

Page 3 of 3

determined, the company can choose to limit their loss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale. 5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible. 6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement document found at 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

2. What is the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? No . Driliship availability was being pushed into hurricane season so the cruise was de layed until spring 2009 to max imize the chanc e for a successfu l endeavor.
3. Was there any criteria used to define BP , Chevron , Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? Th is is described on page 14 as ""In this report , we define major companies to include BP , ChevronTexaco , ExxonMobil, and She!1. The grouping of these four entities does not indicate a regulatory conclusion or an analysis of production size . It is merely a convenient category for the pu rpose of comparison ."" These larger companies , with greater resources to draw on , tend to focus on larger resources that may take greater capita l to develop than smaller independents can consider. This distinction simply makes a convenient way to capture the differences in compan y philosophy that tends to be seen in bidding patterns ,

4. On page 20 , there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250. Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? Com pan ies do not have to give a reason for forfeiting the 115th payment on their bo nus bid. Typ ically, a fo rfeiture is based on a company acquiring new information aft er they have placed th ei r bid. If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally

determined, the company can choose to li mit their !oss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale. 5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated , or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so , how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible . 6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement docu ment found at http://www,mms .gov/reyaldiv/PQFs/FinallnvRptToCongress0501 06.pdf. 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so , how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible .

From: Hunter, Cheri Sent: Tuesday, March 31, 2009 3:37 PM To: Feldgus, Steve Cc: Herdt, Lyn; Gonzales-Evans, Anita; Haenny, Lesley Subject: Remaining questions regarding 2008 Deepwater GOM report Steve, In response to your email of March 11,2009 (third attachment), we have attached information to answer questions number 5 and 7. Cheri

5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-OWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)?
(See attached file ""1996-2007LeasingHistory.pdf""). This contains tables showing leases by year leased, year re-Ieased, and water depth as well as graphs depicting the lease history. The focus is on leases that were leased a second time however, there were a few leases that were re-Ieased for a third time. Since these were fairly small numbers, these were not shown by water depth. It would be a fair assumption that most of these re-Ieased for a third time tended to be shallow water. In more recent years, the blocks that have been re-Ieased tend to be the shallow-water blocks. This is related to the primary terms for shallowwater blocks being 5 years and for deepwater blocks being 10 years.

7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS

10/5/2010

provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM?
(See attached file ""Fig56-DeepWaterReport-SupportingData.xls""). This file contains the data that were used to generate Figure 56 in the Deepwater Report.

Title:

MMS Information Need(s) to be Addressed: Siting issues are extremely important in determining areas of possible alternative energy development. MMS decisions on lease sales must consider potential space-use conflicts on the OCS and consider how these conflicts differ during construction and operations. MMS needs to identify potential space use conflicts of OCS alternative energy development with other activities (e.g., fishing, navigation, sand and gravel extraction etc.), develop criteria for evaluating those conflicts, and identify mechanisms to mitigate existing conflicts and avoid future ones. This study will engage other Federal and state agencies to promote institutional and cross cutting thinking about multiple uses. Information from the study will be used in MMS decision making on siting and monitoring alternative energy development. Cost Range: (in thousands) $500-$750 Period of Performance: FY 2009-2011

Description: Background: The ocean accommodates a variety of uses that are separated by time of day, season, location, and/or zones set aside for specific users. Alternative energy development offers the potential for new use space conflicts with other existing uses of the OCS. Management of ocean space and resources have been addressed by a number of state, regional, and federal organizations - fisheries management councils, state task forces, and coastal zone management agencies, for example, but information on the various uses of these spaces and the potential conflicts as they pertain to alternative energy development are not well documented nor are they understood in terms of type of activity, duration, and timing. Space use conflicts was identified as a social, economic, and cultural concern in the synthesis of existing information on the environmental effects of alternative energy development on the OCS (Michel et aI2007). Avoidance and mitigation measures have not been fully developed for space use conflicts of alternative energy development with other uses, but need to be. Objectives: The purpose of the study is to identify space use conflicts on the OCS between alternative energy development and existing and potential other uses of the OCS and ways to mitigate those conflicts.

Methods: The study will develop a geospatial database that is compatible with the MMS mapping system to assist in determining multiple uses offshore. Through a literature search and key informant discussions, including lessons learned from the European experience, the study will develop a comprehensive list of detailed mitigation measures that can be applied to avoid adverse impacts between alternative energy and other uses that may be present in oes and identify, develop, and evaluate specific proposals to mitigate or resolve potential spatial conflicts between these multiple uses. In addition, the study will explore the possibilities for creating or revising institutional linkages that might facilitate communication and cooperation between the various entities involved and establish a collaborative of key individuals that will develop techniques of co-existence.

While she will do an excellent job there, we will hopefully be able to carryon in her absence! We are pulling together the latest mid-year forecasts for OCS revenues from our budget shop. I would think we would have that information within a half hour or so; would you be available at 10:45 or 11 :OO?

Table B gives the leasing revenues (royalties plus bonuses for this discussion) that are estimated to be generated from leases issued in potential lease sales held in the draft proposed program planning areas. The total leasing revenues for all proposed sales sum to $368 billion in nominal dollars and $56 billion in present value dollars. (Cash flows are discounted at a 7 percent real interest rate plus the inflation rate to obtain present values.) Table B also gives the states' potential shares of the leasing revenues by applicable region, assuming the same revenue sharing formula of 37.5 percent as in GOMESA. They sum to $123 billion in nominal dollars and $18 billion in present value dollars, excluding revenues distributed under section 8(g) of the Act. Based on the projections of net economic value, the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $l.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars. It is assumed that Congress enacts legislation under which all leasing revenues with the states will be shared at 37.5 percent under future legislation, for areas where no sales were included in the 2007-2012 program and which were previously under moratoria. Sales in areas already included in the 2007-2012 leasing program are assumed to share revenues only as provided by GOMESA. That is, sharing begins in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico for revenues starting in FY 2017, except certain parts of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico formerly included in the Lease Sale 181 area or due south of that area, where sharing started in 2008. The estimates provided do not take account of the $500 million annual cap on revenue sharing currently provided in GOMESA for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico planning areas .

Thanks Lyn. This is helpful. One question on pg. 7 . MMS projected the sum of federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program (1.1 trillion nominal dollars / 130 billion present v alue dollars).

Subject: RE: DWRRA leases

Patty and Derek, There is a fairly sizable number of companies that hold interest in OCS leases. The list includes small companies and individuals that have holdings in only one lease to large companies that have holdings in hundreds of leases; and some interest owners are non-oil and gas companies/entities such as insurance and real estate trusts. 1. 2. The number of companies holding OCS leases in the GOM The number of companies holding OCS leases in the OCS 421 444

Our folks are working on the list of companies with interest in leases obtained from GOM sales held in 1996, 1997, and 2000. There are 178 non producing leases and 79 producing or producible leases that were issued in 1996, 1997 and 2000. While the royalty program tracks the leases once a lease begins to produce, we have had to data mine for the interest owners of the non producing leases. We will need to have this full list for the 1996, 1997 and 2000 lease interest owners before we can determine how many compan ies do not have an interest in leases from 1996 - 2000. I am hoping we will have this information for you if not today, early this week.

Patty, there are currently 43 companies that have record title or operating rights interest in the 99/99 GOM deep water leases issued without price thresholds. The first attachment is the latest update provided to Chairman Feinstein on the 98/99 and Kerr McGee. Enclosure #1 to the Feinstein letter lists the companies which have signed price threshold agreements for their 98/99 lease(s) and those companies who have not. Enclosure #3 provides status update on the 98/99 leases, and Enclosure 4 provides the status of leases issued with price thresholds in 1996, 1997 and 2000. Per our clarifying email, I will get back to you with the total number of companies holding GOM leases and all OCS leases; and list of companies holding leases issued in 1996,1997, and 2000.

Energy Alternatives and the Environment
1. Introduction
This report considers energy alternatives to the proposed action in the Proposed Final Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012 (Propos ed Final Program). The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is concerned with energy alternatives for three major reasons: 1. The National Environmental Policy Act requires consideration of a No Action Alternative to the proposed action when preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS). Examining other energy sources is an important aspect of the No Action Alternative for the Proposed Final Program. 2. Those commenting on previous 5-Year Programs have requested consideration of energy alternatives or have suggested that specific energy alternatives are superior to the proposed program. 3. The MMS believes that consideration of alternatives is an important basis for the ultimate decision about the proposed schedule in the Proposed Final Program. The alternatives considered in this report extend beyond the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and even beyond the span of responsibility of the Secretary of the Interior. However, the report only considers environmental impacts associated with production and transportation of the alternative sources of energy. This limitation is chosen in order to keep the discussion parallel to that in the Final EIS accompanying the Proposed Final Program. The rationale for this decision is that OCS oil and natural gas are mixed with similar onshore products and become indistinguishable prior to refining, product transport, and final consumption. Any environmental analysis beyond the mixing point would become an analysis of the entire oil and natural gas industry, which is an insupportable expansion of the boundary of OCS activities. An exception to this bounding occurs in cases where compliance with environmental regulations affects the cost structure of an energy alternative. In those cases, environmental impacts from consumption of the alternative may be mentioned because those impacts may influence the financial viability of the alternative. Understanding alternatives to oil and natural gas requires an appreciation of the complex nature of these materials. Both oil and natural gas are mixtures of many chemical compounds with different mixtures characterizing different geologic deposits. Crude oil, when processed through an atmospheric distillation column, and natural gas, when processed through a separation plant, break into numerous, identifiable categories of organic chemicals, each with a large number of sub-categories. Natural gas, which is mostly methane, often includes heavier hydrocarbon compounds called ""Natural Gas Liquids"" or ""NGL's."" The majority ofNGL's are stripped from the ""wet"" gas at natural gas processing plants. A subset ofthe NGL's, propane and butane, which remain gaseous at ambient pressures and temperatures, are also found in crude oil. Under pressure these

substances form liquids and are known as liquefied petroleum gases (LPG's). Some ofthe heavy NGL's, which are liquid at ambient temperatures and pressures and are also found in crude oil, are referred to as ""natural gasoline"" or ""pentanes plus"" and are classified as lease condensate. Despite NGL's association with natural gas production, this report will follow the standard convention that combines NGL data with crude oil data. An investigation into alternatives to OCS natural gas and oil needs to be built on the following types of information: o the uses of natural gas and oil o the alternatives that can be used to fulfill those uses o the circumstances under which alternatives might be adopted o the financial implications and environmental effects of adopting the alternatives This report is organized around these types of information with emphasis on society's end uses for products derived from natural gas and oil and the alternatives to those end uses. This approach encourages consideration of a broad range of alternatives. It also opens up the possibility to identify creative solutions to the substitution question. Products made from natural gas and oil permeate virtually every aspect of life in a modem industrial society. The next two sections identify the uses of these products.

2. Uses for Oil and NGL's
Society's end uses for oil and NGL's (referred to as oil for the remainder of this discussion) can be categorized into uses for: o transportation vehicles and as fuel for similar machine engines o industrial heat, steam, and cogeneration o residential and commercial heat, hot water, etc. o electricity generation o non-energy uses Table 1 provides statistics on quantities and percentages of oil-based products used in each energy category or sector. As the table shows, oil provides about 40 percent of our energy on a British thermal unit (Btu) basis. It dominates transportation to such an extent that it can be said that U.S. transportation runs on oil. Oil is an important, but not dominant, source of energy to industry. It makes a modest contribution to the residential and commercial sector and only a minor contribution in electricity generation.

Another way to categorize oil use is by the products into which the oil is refined and then sold. Table 2 shows statistics on sales of major oil refinery products. Gasoline constitutes over 58 percent of the total sales volume of oil-based refinery products, jet fuel makes up over 9 percent, and diesel fuel forms a large percentage of the distillate class. It is easy to see that fuels used primarily in transportation constitute most of the volume of refinery products. Table 2. Sales Volume of Oil Refinery Products

2.1. Transportation Vehicles

3

By far the largest and most important use for oil products in the U.S. economy is as transportation fuel. Oil products fuel a majority of vehicles in every major transportation mode.

2. 1. 1. Gasoline-Powered Vehicles and Engines
The automobile is the dominant icon of the American way of life. In a typical year Americans drive about 2.5 trillion miles and use over 120 billion gallons of gasoline going about their work and play (DOE2000). The flexibility, ease of operation and maintenance, performance, and relatively clean running of gasoline engines make them the choice for the vast majority of automobile owners. In addition to cars, gasoline is used to fuel: o light trucks and buses o small boats o reciprocating engine aircraft o light farm tractors o small engines for many industrial , commercial, agricultural, and residential uses

2.1.2. Diesel-Powered Vehicles and Machinery
Diesel engines are the workhorses of the industrial world. Their efficiency and reliability make them the choice for firms and individuals with heavy-duty applications where long-run costs are an important consideration. In addition to the ubiquitous diesel truck, diesels are used to power: o cars o buses o trains o boats o machinery

2.1.3. Jet Fuel-Powered Aircraft
Almost all large passenger airplanes, most large cargo aircraft, and many smaller planes and helicopters are powered by jet engines or use turbo jets for their propulsion. Jet airplanes are almost always faster than their propeller-driven counterparts and turboprop planes and helicopters are usually faster than reciprocating engine models. Because much of the point of flight is to travel faster, jet planes dominate the most important niches in the aviation industry . Jet fuel lies between gasoline and diesel fuel in volatility. It comes in 2 grades ; however, well over 90 percent of jet fuel sold in the U.S . is of the kerosene type.

4

2.1 .4. Steam-Powered Ships
Ships generally use relatively crude steam boilers for their power. Virtually any combustible material can power these boilers although virtually all modern ships use oil-based products for their fuel. In the recent past, ships used some of the lowest grades of residual fuel oil and the heaviest distillates. More recently, air pollution restrictions while ships are in port have led shipping companies to switch to less polluting medium distillates.

2.1 .5. Propane-Powered Industrial and Commercial Vehicles
Industrial and commercial establishments employ LPG's (usually referred to as ""propane"") powered vehicles and machinery, such as forklifts, primarily for off-road applications, because of the generally lower maintenance costs associated with this fuel and the better performance compared to similar electric machinery. Even though LPG is primarily used in off-road applications, LPG-powered vehicles constitute an important class of alternative-fueled vehicles on United States highways (EIA 1999).

2.2. Industrial Sector Uses
Next to the transportation sector, industry uses more oil products than other sectors. However, oil provides less than a third of industrial energy. This percentage has been relatively stable for many years .

2.2.1. Industrial Process Heat and Steam
Heat and steam perform a vast array of tasks for industry from melting metals to driving chemical processes to aiding the bonding of materials. Oil competes with other energy sources for this role and usually wins out in situations where coal produces unacceptable levels of air pollution, natural gas is unavailable in adequate quantities, or capital equipment was originally designed for oil and replacement is too expensive. Steam still powers some machinery, but either electric motors or diesel engines (which were covered along with diesel transportation equipment) now power most machines.

2.2.2. Air Conditioning and Orying
Air conditioning includes both heating and cooling. Oil products are used not only for raising the comfort level of industrial buildings, but also to. create the right air temperature and humidity conditions to maximize the effectiveness of various processes or to minimize maintenance costs. Drying is a response to the many industrial processes involving wet materials. Oil successfully competes for industrial air conditioning and drying in many of the same situations as for industrial process heat and steam.

5

2.2.3. Cogeneration

Cogeneration is the process of using excess or exhaust steam from an industrial process for generating electricity or vice versa. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURP A) requires electric utilities to purchase available power from willing sellers at reasonable prices. Since the passage of PURPA, a large percentage of the potentially viable cogeneration sites have gone into service. Cogeneration now constitutes almost ten percent of U.S. electricity generation and the Department of Energy expects cogeneration to maintain this percentage in the future (ErA 1996b).

2.3. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
The residential and commercial sectors use products made from oil for air conditioning (primarily heating), heating water, and running appliances (in locations not served by electricity). Natural gas and electricity dominate these sectors. Oil products compete best where natural gas is unavailable and the climate is sufficiently cold that electric heat pumps are inefficient. A broad range of oil products serves the residential and commercial sectors from LPG (propane) through kerosene to fuel oil. Choice depends mostly on local availability and already-installed equipment.

2.4. Electricity Generation
2.4.1. Steam Boilers

Most electricity is generated by heating water to the boiling point and directing the expanded volume of steam through a turbine. The rotating shaft of the turbine connects to the shaft of a generator that produces electricity. Virtually any fuel can be used to fire the steam boilers. Until very recently, oil-based products, even relatively cheap residual fuel, had been more expensive per kilowatt of electricity produced than other fuels such as natural gas and coal. Recently, gas prices reached or exceeded the prices per unit of energy of oil-based fuels. Oil-fired steam boilers tend to be used in situations where conversion to natural gas is impractical due to unavailability of gas or where it would be too expensive to convert.
2.4.2. Diesel Generators

Diesel engines can also be used to tum the shaft of a generator to produce electricity. Diesels are usually only used in remote sites where the electricity demand is too small to justify the expense of installing a steam boiler and transportation of diesel fuel is relatively inexpensive.

2.5. Non-Energy Uses
2.5.1. Chemical Feedstock

The chemical industry converts NGL's and oil refinery products into a vast array of goods for industry and final consumers. Plastics, artificial fibers, paints and preservatives, agricultural chemicals, and many pharmaceuticals are all made primarily from NGL's and oil refinery
6

products. Although our economy consumes large quantities of these products, the amount of oil going into them is much less than that which goes into energy applications, especially transportation.

2.5.2. Solvents, Lubricants, Asphalts, and Waxes
Several other groups of chemicals are made from oil and LPG's but retain much of their original characteristics even after chemical conversion. These are solvents, lubricants, asphalts, and waxes. The properties of the various types of LPG and oil used in these products are enhanced in the chemical conversion process but retain much of their original nature.

3. Uses for Natural Gas
As table 3 shows, the industrial, residential, and commercial sectors are the largest consumers of natural gas. Electricity generation uses less gas than the preceding sectors; however, it is the fastest growing major use of natural gas. The figure shown for transportation refers only to the use of natural gas in pipeline transportation.

3.1. Industrial Sector Uses
On a Btu basis, the percentage of energy industry derives from natural gas surpassed oil-derived products in 1987 making it the largest source of energy for this sector. However, in 2001 natural gas fell behind oil in response to the relative rise in natural gas prices on a Btu basis. Natural gas maintains an important position as a source of industrial energy for two major reasons: 1. Burning natural gas produces less air pollution, including greenhouse gases, than any other fossil fuel. This allows industry to use natural gas buming technology without expensive pollution control equipment that might be required for other energy sources . 2. The cleaner burning and handling character of natural gas tends to keep maintenance costs 7

low. Further adoption of natural gas is limited by relatively high prices, the unavailability of secure supplies, and by equipment designed for other energy sources which has not yet reached the replacement point. Industry uses natural gas for the same purposes as it uses oil-based fuels: o industrial process heat and steam o air conditioning and drying o cogeneration These industrial processes use much the same technology for both natural gas and oil-based fuels. Differences derive mostly from the gaseous nature of natural gas versus the liquid nature of most oil-based products. Of special note is that a majority of United States cogeneration is fueled with natural gas.

3.2. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
Natural gas performs much the same role in the residential and commercial sectors as oil: to condition air (primarily to heat it), to heat water, and to run appliances in locations not served by electricity. Natural gas and electricity dominate these sectors. The residential and commercial sectors favor natural gas because of its low cost and low maintenance. Recent relative price increases and lack of access or the expense of access to gas pipelines limits the further penetration of natural gas into these sectors.

3.3. Electricity Generation
The natural gas industry considers electricity generation to be its growth sector. In recent years electric utilities have been slow to add new generating capacity. However, rapidly increasing electricity demand, most notably in California, has forced electric utilities to consider adding significantly to their generating capacity. Natural gas will fire most new power plants under construction and probably those in the planning stages as well.

3.3.1. Turbines
Much new and planned electricity generating capacity consists of gas turbines. Gas turbines operate by directing the hot gases from burning natural gas into a turbine. As in a steam boiler, the rotating shaft of the turbine connects to the shaft of a generator that produces electricity. Electric utilities have to deal with vast swings in the demand for their power. So-called peaks in demand occur on summer afternoons when air conditioning reaches its maximum and on winter evenings when electric ranges and other appliances add their draw to heating. Peaking power is the most expensive power for utilities to produce. Gas turbines, because of their very rapid fireup capability, along with hydroelectric and pump storage capacity, constitute the equipment of choice for peaking. In addition, their low initial capital cost, relatively low maintenance, and efficiency make gas turbines highly competitive with coal-fired plants, which require expensive pollution control
8

technology.

3.3.2. Steam Boilers
Gas-fired steam boilers are very similar to oil-fired models; indeed, some boilers are designed to use either fuel with only minor adjustments. Most duel-fuel boilers and most boilers that can be inexpensively converted to gas already use gas because of its reduced air pollution and less expensive maintenance.

3.3.3. Combined Cycle
Combined cycle plants first use natural gas to fire gas turbines, then they use the hot gases from the turbine exhaust to create steam which is used to generate electricity in the same way as in normal cycle steam generation. The cost of electricity generated using combined cycle technology compares favorably with that produced using other fuels in conventional plants. The possibility also exists to use the hot water remaining when the steam condenses in a cogeneration mode.

3.4. Transportation
The 2004 transportation sector consumption of natural gas reported in table 3 consists entirely of gas used to power the pumps and other machinery that moves natural gas across the country via pipelines. Any natural gas used in motor vehicles is reported in the residential and commercial sector because almost all the natural gas vehicles in service in the United States are fleet vehicles operated by commercial establishments. Vehicular use of natural gas is growing rapidly (see table 6). Nevertheless, natural gas accounts for only a small percentage of the highway fuel used in the United States.

3.5. Non-Energy Uses
Natural gas, primarily methane, is also used as a chemical feedstock. Among the products made from natural gas are chemicals like methanol, ammonia, and formaldehyde that are converted into final products like fertilizer, detergents, and glues.

4. The No Action Alternative
The National Environmental Policy Act requires consideration of a No Action Alternative to every major Federal action significantly affecting the environment. In the case of the Proposed Final Program, no action means that the MMS would hold no OCS oil and gas lease sales during the 5-year period covered by the Program. An absence of lease sales means production firms do not obtain rights to new oil and natural gas resources on the OCS . As a result, the oil and natural gas that would have been produced as a consequence of sales over that 5-year period would not be available to consumers. This section reports the results of an investigation into the most likely response of oil and natural gas markets to a curtailment of their supplies from the OCS and the ensuing environmental

9

impacts. Under these assumptions, markets would have to respond to a reduction in supply equal to the anticipated production from the 5-Year Program. Note that in a typical year almost twothirds of OCS production on a Btu basis has consisted of natural gas (MMS 2001). The other one-third or so has been oil and NGL's. Recently, the percentage of oil has been increasing and in the near future OCS oil production is projected to surpass gas on a Btu basis (Farndon 2006).

4.1.

Methodology

The MMS employs the MarketSim model to evaluate the impact of decreased OCS production resulting from no action. MarketSim estimates changes in quantities of alternatives to OCS natural gas and oil traded in domestic markets. This same model, which includes oil and gas submodels, also performs other analyses used in the development of the 5-Year Program. A more detailed description of the market simulation model can be found in a companion paper to this one (King 2007).

4.2. Market Response to a Reduction in

oes Production

The MMS ran MarketSim for low and high cases chosen to bracket the most likely range of future conditions. The purpose of these runs was to demonstrate the response of oil and gas markets to a reduction in OCS production under a variety of circumstances. The MMS has chosen to base its analysis on an oil price of $46 per barrel (bbl) and a natural gas wellhead price of $6.96 per mcf. While these prices are somewhat below recent open market prices, they are thought to represent a realistic estimate of the kind of long-term prices the oil and gas industry will be using for making its development decisions. 4.2.1. Results for Oil Table 4 shows the most important results of runs comparing the Proposed Program to no action under the low and high cases. The percentage estimates, which are almost identical for the low and high cases, are the most interesting and useful numbers in the table. They imply that for each hundred barrels of OCS oil not produced: o onshore U.S. oil production will increase by about 3 barrels o U. S. oil imports will increase by about 88 barrels o conservation will account for a decline in U.S. oil consumption of about 5 barrels o switching to gas will amount to the equivalent of about 4 barrels In absolute terms expectations are for: o onshore production to make up 200 million of the 5.7 billion barrels lost through no action at the low price and 300 million of the 12.1 billion barrels of OCS production lost at the high price o imports to account for 5.1 billion barrels at the low price and 10.7 billion barrels at the high price

conservation to total the equivalent of 300 million barrels at the low price and 600 million at the high price switching to gas the equivalent of 200 million barrels at the low price and 500 million at the high price (MarketSim deals with the oil and gas markets in isolation. In reality, if OCS production were curtailed, less OCS gas would lead to more imported oil, conservation, and domestic onshore oil and gas production than the model shows.)

All these amounts would substitute for the 5.7 billion barrels of oil lost through no action at the low price and 12.1 billion barrels at the high price. The distribution of conservation and switching to gas by sector depends on the amount of consumption in each sector and the price elasticities of demand in each sector. Transportation accounted for 68 percent and industrial consumption 24 percent of U.S. oil use in 2004. Residential and commercial consumption accounted for about 6 percent (EIA 2006). Other forms of energy cannot readily substitute for most of this oil in the near term. In the U.S. transportation sector, a consumption decline would probably involve a reduction in miles traveled, the purchase of more fuel-efficient cars, or both. Most energy projections show relatively little alternative fuel, such as ethanol, entering the transportation sector for many years (EIA 200 1b). However, ethanol consumption in the transportation sector increased 350 percent from 1996 to 2005 (EIA 2006). Significant additional fuel substitution in response to the relatively small price increase implied by the model would be unlikely. In addition to the 11

modest price increase associated with these scenarios, the costs of replacing the present transportation fuel infrastructure fmiher hinders efforts to extend the use of alternative transportation fuels. In the industrial sector most uses for which there exists a ready substitute for oil have already converted to the substitute. Many industrial uses such as for products like asphalt and lube oils have few comparable substitutes. Oil use in the residential and commercial sectors is forecast to occur principally at locations without access to natural gas, so little fuel substitution can be expected. The only applications where significant substitution is likely are industrial heat and steam and electricity generation. The degree of substitution in these sectors depends on whether oil is competing directly with gas for market share. In the recent past, natural gas and oil did not compete in the boiler market because gas was significantly cheaper. Recently, as gas prices rose past the level of oil prices in these sectors, only a modest amount of fuel switching took place. Because of gas's greater efficiency and environmental superiority, only moderate switching will likely occur unless gas prices rise significantly higher than oil.

4.2.2. Results for Natural Gas
Table 4 also reveals that for each thousand cubic feet (Mct) of OCS gas not produced because of no action, MMS anticipates the following results: o U.S. onshore gas production will increase by 0.28 Mcf o imports will increase by 0.16 Mcf o conservation will account for about 0.16 Mcf o switching to oil will amount to the equivalent of about 0.39 or 0.40 Mcf In absolute terms in the low case this amounts to: o 5.8 trillion cubic feet (Tct) of onshore gas o 3.3 Tcf of gas imports (mostly from Canada) o conservation equivalent to 3.4 Tcf of gas o switching to oil equivalent to 8.2 Tcf of gas substituting for the 20.7 Tcf of OCS natural gas lost through no action. In absolute terms in the high case this amounts to: o 10.3 Tcf of onshore gas o 5.9 Tcf of gas imports (mostly from Canada) o conservation equivalent to 5.9 Tcf of gas o switching to oil equivalent to 14.3 Tcf of gas substituting for the 36.4 trillion cubic feet of OCS natural gas lost through no action. Of the reduced consumption of natural gas in the low case, the equivalent of about 8.2 Tcf of gas would consist of switching to oil. This means that an additional 1.5 billion barrels of oil would clear the market. Assuming that imports constitute 88 percent of any additional oil traded in the U.S. market, this adds another 1.3 billion barrels of oil to imports. Thus, as a result of no action,
12

an additional 6.4 billion barrels of oil would have to be imported by the U.S . The corresponding import estimate for the high case is 12.9 billion barrels of oil.

4.3. Environmental Impacts from the Market Response to a Reduction in OCS Production
4.3.1. Onshore Oil and Gas Production
Onshore oil and gas are often produced together from the same wells; furthermore, the impacts from eff0l1s to recover the two resources are almost identical even in those cases where production from a given location is entirely oil or entirely gas. Onshore oil and gas production has notable negative impacts on surface water, groundwater, and wildlife. Onshore oil and gas production can also be expected to cause negative impacts on soils, air pollution, vegetation, noise, and odor. Surface water could incur increased turbidity, salinity, and sedimentation caused by runoff from road, drilling pad, and pipeline construction. Other sources of water pollution include discharges of drilling muds, other toxic chemicals, and engine fuels and lubricants. Although holding ponds or reserve pits for produced waters and other process waste are required to retain any environmentally hazardous substances, spills of such materials into surface waters are a risk. Groundwater can be contaminated from puncture of the aquifer or from leaching down from improperly sealed surface holding ponds or overflow of those ponds onto permeable surfaces. In many areas, sufficient interchange occurs between surface and groundwater sources that pollution of one leads to the contamination of the other. For the most part, surface disturbance from oil and gas development is sufficiently limited that it causes relatively minor negative impacts on wildlife. A large portion of the negative impact on wildlife comes through water pollution and the impacts on wildlife living in or drinking from a water supply contaminated by oil and gas extraction activities. However, holding ponds can pose a significant threat to birds, especially waterfowl. Improperly safeguarded holding ponds can prove attractive to waterfowl and other birds looking for a safe resting and feeding location. Birds landing on these ponds may drown when the action of solvents in the pond material destroys the buoyancy of their feathers. Soil and vegetative disturbance is mostly a result of construction activities. However, soils can become contaminated and vegetation killed by spills of herbicidal chemicals. Diesel engines employed in construction, drilling, and production contribute to air and noise pollution. Chemicals used in drilling and production can create noxious odors. Local standards may partially control these impacts, but oil and gas production adds to the cumulative burden of these pollutants.

4.3.2. Imports
Environmental impacts associated with expanded importation of oil include: o generation of greenhouse gases and regulated air pollutants from both transport and
13

o o o

dockside activities (emissions of NO x, SOx, and VOCs having an impact on acid rain, tropospheric ozone formation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and global climate change) degradation of water quality from oil spills associated with accidental or intentional discharges or tanker casualties possible destruction of flora, fauna, and recreational and scenic land and water areas in the instance of oil spills public fear of the increased likelihood of oil spills

Air pollution and oil spills vie for the dubious distinction of being the most important ofthese classes of impact. Oil spills are certainly the negative events most people associate with oil importation. Table 5 shows by region the estimated additional spills greater than 1000 barrels associated with the no action alternative, along with their probabilities.

The environmental impacts from oil spills are well documented in the EIS for the 5-Year Program. Tanker spills tend to be larger events than those from OCS pipelines. While it is uncertain where the spills associated with additional imports will occur, the majority of tanker spills occur in port or near shore where the potential environmental impact is more severe. 14

This report does not address environmental impacts outside the United States. In the case of imported oil, negative environmental impacts in producing countries and in countries along trade routes can be significant, especially where environmental protection standards are lower than those in the U.S.

4.3.3. Conservation
As shown in table 4, the price increase induced by the no action alternative will lead people to conserve about 6 percent of expected oil consumption and 16 percent of expected natural gas consumption. This conservation is composed of two major components: o substituting energy saving technology, often embodied in new capital equipment, for energy resources (for example, adding to home insulation) o consuming less of an energy using service (for example, turning down the thermostat in an office during the winter) This paper discusses the environmental impacts from oil and gas conservation in sections 6 and 7, respectively.

4.3.4. Fuel Switching
Table 4 shows people switching 4 percent of their consumption from oil to gas and 40 percent from gas to oil. This seemingly anomalous result is a function of the two submodels used to estimate the oil and gas market responses. To keep the analysis simple, the two submodels account for the price change in their market in isolation from the other market. In reality, there would probably be no switching from oil to gas. Because it is much easier to increase oil imports than gas imports, the price of gas would rise relative to the price of oil and people would switch to oil. This would shift the demand for oil at the same time the supply was being restricted. The major source to satisfy this increased demand would be imports that would add to the imports induced by the initial oil supply decrease.

5. Government Imposition of Energy Alternatives
In the U.S. economy, market forces make most decisions about the allocation of resources. However, government sometimes chooses to override market decisions in order to change the economy's energy mix. This section will investigate specific forms of energy government might choose as substitutes for OCS natural gas and oil and some of the consequences of those choices. Even if leasing on the OCS proceeds, government can choose policies having the effect of imposing various energy alternatives on society. These policies may be chosen to : o minimize reliance on imports, such as oil, from unstable regions o encourage the use of a politically favored fuel, such as ethanol o reduce air pollution, such as by mandating electric vehicles conserve energy

o

Among the policy tools government can use to encourage or force the adoption of a desired
15

energy mIX are: o taxes o subsidies o performance standards

5.1. Taxes to Achieve a Desired Energy Mix
Government can impose either broad-based or narrowly focused energy taxes. A broad-based energy tax would tax all or a broad spectrum of energy alternatives. An example, which has been discussed at considerable length, is the carbon tax. The carbon tax would impose a levy on all hydrocarbon materials used as sources of energy in proportion to the amount of carbon the material contains. The carbon tax is aimed at controlling the sources of greenhouse gases that have been found to contribute to global warn1ing. The increased cost of fuels containing carbon would encourage consumers to switch to non-carbon sources of energy such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, and nuclear. It would also encourage conservation both through the substitution of capital for energy and through reduced use. Narrowly focused energy, taxes include the taxes imposed by national and state governments on vehicle fuels. These fuel taxes have the primary purpose of raising money to pay for highway, road, and bridge construction and maintenance. Theoretically, they also have the effect of discouraging people from using automobile transportation and substituting trains, planes, or buses. By their nature taxes distort market signals in the economy. In the case of energy taxes, they impose a direct cost on energy consumers and producers (who suffer a loss of profits).

5.2. Subsidies for Energy Alternatives
Many governments subsidize favored energy sources, actions usually justified as a temporary aid to start an infant industry. Recent examples in the U.S. are tax rebates for ethanol used as a gasoline additive and the subsidy extended to coal bed methane extraction for addition to the natural gas system. Subsidies that reward production of an energy product serve to reduce that product's unit costs and thus lower the supply curve for the product leading to increased use and enhanced profits for producers. Subsidies can also take the form of grants to consumers. Home heating subsidies for the poor in the U.S. are an example of this approach. Consumer energy subsidies tend to raise the effective demand curves for the fuels involved leading to greater sales and profits. This type of subsidy tends to apply to a range of different energy sources capable of performing the function being supported, such as heating homes in winter. Although home heating subsidies tend to increase fuel use, subsidies for things like insulation and weatherization are sometimes used to encourage fuel conservation. On the cost side, taxpayers must pay for the subsidies, further distorting market signals. In addition, unintended consequences may result from imperfect government decisions.

16

5.3. Energy Performance Standards and Regulations
Energy perfonnance standards and the regulations developed to implement them are one of the cornerstones of U.S. energy policy. The best known set of energy performance standards are the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standards that set the average fleet vehicle miles per gallon of gasoline that each automobile manufacturer must meet with the set (fleet) of vehicles the manufacturer produces in a year.

6. Alternatives to Oil and NGL's and Their Environmental Impacts
Primary alternatives to OCS oil are imported oil and oil from onshore production. In addition to these primary alternatives, other materials and forms of energy can be substituted for oil to provide the services consumers demand. However, only five basic ways exist to replace the oil society decides not to obtain from the OCS: import, produce onshore, switch fuel, substitute oil saving technology, or accept less service. The total number of specific alternatives fitting within these broad categories appears almost endless. Nevertheless, the basic approaches to replacement are limited. The same point holds true for natural gas. Importation and onshore production are covered in section 4.3. This section will review the other potential substitutes for OCS oil. The discussion will cover the potential future market and the environmental impacts from the production and transportation of the original energy resource for each specific energy alternative.

6.1. Transportation Vehicle Fuel
Table 1 shows the transportation sector to be by far the largest user of oil and oil products being the overwhelmingly dominant transpOltation fuels in the U.S. economy. Thus, the transportation sector is the first place to look for ways to replace oil. In the words of the 1991 National Energy Strategy (DOE 1991), ""The transportation sector offers the best available opportunity to reduce U.S. dependence on oil, improve the quality of air in metropolitan areas, and spur the development and use of new, more efficient, environmentally superior vehicle and fuel technology."" Oil can be replaced by switching to other fuels, adopting more efficient vehicles, implementing more efficient transportation systems, and accepting less motorized transportation. The latter three of these alternatives are examples of conservation.

17

6. 1. 1. Alternative Fuels
Table 6 lists the consumption of alternative fuels and the number of alternative-fueled vehicles in the United States for 2000 estimated by the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy lnfonnation Administration (EIA 2000). LPG powers more of these vehicles than any other alternative fuel. This is an oil product so it is not relevant to this discussion. Clearly the most popular non-oil-based alternative fuels are compressed natural gas and ethanol. Other fuels may have future potential, but none is a viable presence yet.

Alternatives to Traditional Transportation

6.1.1.1. Natural Gas
Two forms of natural gas can be utilized as transportation vehicle fuel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The use of LNG is limited to a few heavy-duty trucks and, primarily, passenger buses in three large programs (Houston, Seattle, and Los Angeles). The CNG's easier and cheaper conversion and handling give it the lead in current applications to 18

transportation. The recent growth in the number of CNG vehicles has greatly exceeded that of all other types of alternative fuels. Montgomery and Sweeney (1991) explain this growth, "" Compressed natural gas is now the alternative fuel with the lowest net cost, considering all factors , and appears to be finding its way into the market under current policies. Its role may be greatest in fleet operations, especially those involving large vehicles, where central refueling and some loss in vehicle space is not important, and where the low cost of natural gas fuel is important. "" EIA (1996) adds that other factors promoting the growth of CNG are ""support from natural gas utilities, relatively greater availability of vehicles and fuels compared to most other alternative fuels, and continued public and private sector enthusiasm for the fuel."" The technical problems with CNG fuel cylinders have apparently been solved. Furthermore, some cities, like New York and Washington, DC, are turning to natural gas to power their urban buses as a method of reducing air pollution (Layton 2000). The natural gas to be utilized as a transportation fuel in the form of CNG can be supplied from OCS, domestic onshore, pipeline imports from Canada, or imported LNG sources. Environmental impacts from domestic OCS production are covered in the 5-Year EIS. Domestic onshore production is covered in section 4.3.1. of this paper. Additional pipeline imports from Canada would require additional pipelines. Associated construction would lead to temporary increases in water pollution from unstable construction sites and spills of construction-related fuels and other chemicals. LNG imports experienced a record high of 507 Bcfin 2003. Although that only amounts to 2.7 percent of U.S . consumption and 13 percent of imports, this form of importation is expected to rise dramatically. As of 2004 applications had been filed or pre filed for 19 new LNG terminals to join the four already in operation. Five of the filings were for offshore LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mexico . The increased interest in LNG is driven by new technology making the method more efficient, the growth in LNG export terminals throughout the world, and the price advantage of foreign natural gas over increasingly expensive domestic sources. The LNG imports introduce a new form of environmental impact. In addition to the risk of fuel spills from LNG ships, there is a slight risk of an LNG leak. Because it is super cold, as LNG vaporizes, the cold vapors gather close to the ground where they smother any animal inhabitants. If a large quantity of the vapors could be ignited, they would produce a violent explosion. Fortunately, the risk of such an occurrence is very low.

.

6.1.1.2. Methanol
Two forms of methanol find application as transportation fuels : M85 , which is 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline, and MIOO, which is pure (neat) methanol. Apparently, MIOO use has peaked. Because of the poor performance and maintenance record it has compiled, little additional M 100 use is expected in the future (EIA 2000). 19

Adoption ofM85 as a transportation fuel seems to be governed by the cost of methanol. Four variables go into the price of methanol as a transportation fuel: 1) the price of natural gas because virtually all commercial methanol is made from natural gas, 2) the cost of building the very large conversion plants needed to capture economies of scale, 3) the cost of developing the necessary new distribution system, and 4) the demand for methanol for other purposes. Methanol is a raw material in the creation of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a major constituent of reformulated gasoline. Recent demand for reformulated gasoline has driven up the price of methanol and it is still uncertain where the price will eventually settle. Nevertheless, the use ofM85 has declined from its high in the late 1990's. There remains a question about whether M85 will ever find a larger niche in the transportation sector. Conversion of gasoline and diesel powered vehicles to methanol is relatively inexpensive; however, dual powered vehicles capable of using either gasoline and methanol or diesel and methanol seem to encounter technical problems. The process of conversion from gasoline to methanol entails the development of a new fuel distribution network. The implication of this requirement is that a major conversion effort must be launched to make this alternative viable. However, the effort need not be nationwide. A regional market, if it were large enough and well enough defined, could be converted without involving the rest of the nation. Because most commercially available methanol is made from natural gas, the extraction step in the process has been covered in the 5-Year Program EIS and section 4.3. of this paper. Production of methanol from natural gas, depending on the precise technology used, may lead to additional discharges of atmospheric pollutants with resultant impacts on local air quality, acid rain, stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, and greenhouse gasses. The production process may also lead to discharges of contaminated and heated water into streams, rivers, and lakes.

6. 1. 1.3. Ethanol
In addition to its use as a gasoline additive, two different forms of ethanol are potential alternative fuels. E95 is 95 percent ethanol and 5 percent gasoline. Like MlOO, users are showing little interest in E95. E85 consists of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. Through 1995 users have shown only modest interest in E85 vehicles. However, beginning in 1997, Chevrolet S-1 0 and GMC Sonoma pickup trucks produced by General Motors have been flexible fuel vehicles that can use either gasoline or E85 (EIA 2000). More recently, General Motors has expanded the list of flexible fuel vehicles it manufactures. The principal problem with ethanol is its high cost. Present interest undoubtedly stems from subsidies in the form of exemptions from Federal and some state excise taxes. Because ethanol is corrosive and an absorbent of water, it cannot be transported through conventional pipelines. These characteristics make it incompatible with present liquid fuel distribution systems. A viable, large-scale ethanol industry requires a new infrastructure including new transportation, storage, and dispensing equipment. Distillers produce ethanol through the fermentation of a sugar-containing biological product. Corn is the feedstock most widely used for ethanol production in North America. Research into 20

the use of cellulose as a feedstock for ethanol production has opened up the possibility of using wood fiber, grasses, and other woody vegetation as a cheap raw material (Lovins 2006). Farmers may grow additional corn needed to meet expanded ethanol demand principally on land now considered marginal for crop production. They will have to remove land from less intense uses to devote to this intensively cultivated row crop. This action will result in significant increases in soil erosion, fertilizer runoff, and systemic effects through expanded uses of pesticides and herbicides. The net effect will be deteriorated water quality through siltation, eutrophication, and chemical toxicity. Upland wildlife habitat will be diminished through loss of cover and the effects of chemical toxicity. Wildlife will also be adversely affected by the additional rural activity associated with the more intense agriculture. Production of ethanol uses great quantities of water and leads to releases of large quantities of oxygen depleting materials into streams and rivers. The net effect is significant further deterioration of water quality. Ethanol production also has deleterious impacts on local air quality through hydrocarbon releases and on greenhouse gases through copious CO 2 releases .

6. 1. 1.4. Electricity
The future of electric vehicles is dominated by state mandates for zero emission vehicles (ZEV's). Starting in 1998, California, New York, and Massachusetts require that 2 percent of the vehicles sold in the state be ZEV's. The requirement increases incrementally to 10 percent in 2003 (EIA 1996). Electric vehicles are the only ones that have zero emissions (at the point of use). Electric vehicles suffer from some performance problems; however, the ultimate limitations on electric vehicle acceptance revolve around technical problems with batteries. Batteries are too heavy, take too long to recharge, do not hold sufficient charge, and (most important) are much too expensive. Until these problems are solved, or at least ameliorated, consumers are unlikely to freely choose electric vehicles over vehicles powered with internal combustion engines or hybrids. The only way to overcome this rejection would be to induce consumers to take electric vehicles or to do as the three states above are and force the automobile companies to offer consumers incentives.
If the battery technology problems are overcome, or if ZEV mandates are effective, the substantial adoption of electric vehicles will greatly increase the demand for electricity. Meeting increased demand for electricity will lead to the kinds of environmental impacts noted in section 7.1 , which deals with electricity generation.

6.1.1.5. Hydrogen
Hydrogen powered fuel cells could be used in a new generation of vehicles designed to minimize final use air pollution in urban areas. One article put it this way, ""One day, many experts believe, the auto industry could virtually wean itself completely from fossil fuels with so-called fuel cells that use hydrogen. But that day is at least 20 years away (BusinessWeek 200 I)."" Hydrogen fuel cell technology faces three major impediments: 21

o o o

hydrogen production using present technology is expensive-requiring large amounts of electricity no distribution network exists hydrogen is relatively hard to transport over long distances

If the U.S. Government decided to pursue hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on a large scale, we would have to develop major additions to the electricity production infrastructure. The impacts of this development are discussed in the section on electricity generation (7.1). Research on the use of enzymes found in organisms growing in extreme conditions has found a way to produce hydrogen from glucose and presumably other sugars and similar materials including perhaps even cellulose. If this approach proves to be financially feasible, it may become a major source of energy for the future. It will be decades before this technology is implemented on a broad scale. Nevertheless, hydrogen powered fuel cells have the potential to eventually replace the internal combustion engine as the primary transportation engine. The resulting ""hydrogen economy"" could revolutionize the world fuel mix (EREN 2001). MMS is studying the potential for hydrogen production as a means of transporting energy produced from advanced technologies on the OCS. 6.1.2 More Efficient Vehicles One good way to conserve energy, or in this case to substitute for OCS oil, is to adopt more efficient transportation vehicles. Essentially this can be accomplished either by improving the efficiency of engines and transmissions or by adopting lighter and more streamlined vehicle bodies. Government interference in the market place often leads to unintended consequences. Potentially, that could be the case with more fuel-efficient vehicles and other government energy programs. For instance, more fuel-efficient cars might encourage car owners to drive more. This would partially negate any fuel savings. In addition, greater automobile efficiency might discourage use of even more efficient alternative modes of transportation such as mass transit or ride sharing. Nevertheless, more efficient vehicles are likely to be a highly effective way to decrease the aggregate demand for oil in the transportation sector. 6.1.2. 1. Improved Engines and Transmissions Automobile manufacturers have responded to the CAFE standards by steadily increasing the fuel economy of cars sold in the United States market. Major contributors to this increased efficiency have been more efficient engines and transmissions. Although more efficient engines and transmissions presumably burn gasoline for fuel, the potential exists for this alternative to decrease further the amount of oil consumed in automobile transportation. The problem with this alternative is that it increases the cost of new automobiles. No negative environmental consequences stem from this alternative. This desirable outcome is undoubtedly the basis for the current Government-private industry partnership to produce a more fuel-efficient automobile. Several auto makers have introduced hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles in the American market. These automobiles use small, efficient gasoline engines for cruising. While the cars are cruising or braking, they charge specially designed batteries attached to highly efficient and powerful electric motors. The electric motors take control when needed for extra power and during stop 22

and go driving while the gasoline engine waits in reserve until it is needed when the batteries run down or for sustained high speed driving. Virtually all hybrid vehicles qualify as ultra-efficient vehicles. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than gasoline engines for any particular application. Diesel engines dominate markets for trucks, buses, and trains. Consumers resist diesel engines in cars because: o their performance characteristics are poorer than gasoline engines o they are more expensive o they are harder to start o older models were smelly and smoky and the perception persists o diesel fuel is less widely available than gasoline However, if car companies choose to market the cleaner burning diesel engines currently popular in Europe and consumers can be convinced to accept them, diesels could effect a major decline in oil use. Diesel hybrids could be even more efficient.

5-

6.1 .2.2. Lighter, More Streamlined Vehicle Bodies
Vehicles with lighter, more streamlined bodies would also save additional fuel. Manufacturers have made significant progress in this direction, but more is still possible. One study reached the conclusion that decreasing the weight of automobiles would result in about two-thirds of the potential increase in fuel efficiency that could be expected using state-of-the-art design (Lovins 2006). Increasing the proportions of aluminum and plastic composites could reduce vehicle weights. Lightweight steel can be almost as light and cheaper than the other alternatives. Lighter weight vehicles have several problems: o they are more expensive o they are thought to be less safe o they may be more expensive to repair in case of collision damage o they may be less acceptable to buyers looking for a ""solid"" steel car or truck More streamlined cars may be less acceptable because buyers find the style of such cars too extreme for their taste. More streamlined bodies should have few negative environmental consequences. Environmental consequences of lighter bodies would depend on the materials of which they are made. Plastic composites usually use oil as a raw material so the amount of oil embodied in the construction of lighter vehicles based on plastic is likely to increase. However, the life cycle oil use of the lighter vehicles is likely to decrease. Similarly, aluminum requires more energy to produce than the amount of steel needed to perform the same function ; nevertheless, life cycle oil savings are likely to accrue to an increase in the proportion of aluminum.

6.1.3. More Efficient Transportation Systems
The United States has the least energy efficient transportation system among the major industrialized countries. Improving the efficiency of this system would reduce the single largest source of oil demand in our economy. Among the possible approaches for achieving this end are : 23

o o o

using more mass transit and car pools increasing the percentage of rail transport designing and building more efficient road systems

6. 1.3.1. More Mass Transit and Car Pools

A large portion of automobile use is for commuting to and from work. A large percentage of workers commute alone in their automobiles. Enticing commuters to use mass transit and car pools on a large scale would save vast quantities of oil. Although such a switch in transportation mode should save money for commuters, a majority are unwilling to make the switch because they like the freedom and convenience afforded by driving one's own car. The environmental consequences of switching to mass transit and car pools would be entirely positive. Air, water, land, noise, and visual aesthetics would all be improved. 6.1.3.2. Greater Use of Rail Transportation Trains are more energy efficient than trucks, buses, cars, or planes. Increasing the portion of goods and passengers traveling by rail would save oil. Train travel is avoided because it tends to be slower, door-to-door, than the other modes listed and it often entails mode changes to reach destinations not served by railroad lines. Increased rail travel would tend to have positive environmental consequences although there could be negative impacts from construction if rail transportation became sufficiently popular to require additional rail lines. However, net impacts to air, water, land, and noise would all decline. 6. 1.3.3. Improved Road Systems Road systems can be designed to handle the same volume of traffic more efficiently. Adequate road space to handle peak loads at normal speeds is one way to do this. Timing traffic lights and installing more ""smart"" traffic lights to keep high volume traffic moving are others. Building more free flowing highways is a third way to increase efficiency. Unfortunately, these alternatives tend to be expensive and to lead to higher use by motorists abandoning mass transit for the freedom and speed of individual commuting. The environmental consequences of more efficient roads depend on the impacts of construction and the space usurped by increasing the land area devoted to roads.
6. 1.4. Less Motorized Transportation

Another way to save oil currently going into motorized transportation is to do less of it. People would tend to use less transportation if its price increased. Taxes could be used to decrease transportation use. Given the unpopularity of increasing taxes, it is unlikely that this alternative will be used to any great extent. Other approaches to less motorized transportation include telecommuting and non-motorized vehicles. 6.1.4.1. Telecommuting Allowing workers to use computers and to perform other work-related activities in their homes saves the oil that would be used in commuting. Telecommuting is limited by:
24

o o o

work unsuited to the home environment difficulty supervising workers interruptions from other family members

Negative environmental consequences of telecommuting are virtually nonexistent.

6.1.4.2. Non-motorized Transportation
Adopting non-motorized forms of transportation provides another approach to reducing the oil consumed by motorized transportation. In practical terms this means bicycles and walking. Both modes tend to be more time consuming and limited in flexibility compared to automobiles. However, with more jobs being located in suburban campuses near workers' homes, nonmotorized transportation has become more practical for more people. Using bicycles and walking have only the most minimal negative environmental consequences.

6.2. Industrial Sector Uses
Natural gas constitutes the primary alternative to oil in the industrial sector. Environmental consequences of expanded natural gas production are covered in section 4.3. and the 5-Year Program EIS. The other alternatives to oil in the industrial sector tend to be identical to those for natural gas . These other alternatives are discussed in section 7.2. because natural gas is a more important fuel in the industrial sector than oil.

6.3. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
As is true in the industrial sector, natural gas constitutes the primary alternative to oil in the residential and commercial sectors. Similarly, environmental consequences of expanded natural gas production are covered in section 4.3. and the 5-Year Program EIS. The other alternatives to oil for the residential and commercial sectors tend to be identical to those for natural gas. These other alternatives are discussed in section 7.2. because natural gas is a more important fuel in the residential and commercial sectors than oil.

6.4. Electricity Generation
Natural gas is also one of the major alternatives to oil for electricity generation. Environmental consequences of expanded natural gas production are covered in section 4.3. and the 5-Year Program EIS. The other alternatives to oil for electricity generation tend to be identical to the alternatives to natural gas. These other alternatives are discussed in section 7. 1. because natural gas is a more important fuel for electricity generation than oil.

6.5. Non-Energy Uses
The major non-energy uses of oil and NGL 's are as a feedstock for chemicals and as a raw material for solvents, lubricants, asphalts, and waxes. The alternatives for both types of nonenergy use tend to be identical so they are discussed together.

6.5. 1. Alternative Raw Materials

Oil and NGL's consist of hydrocarbons of varying complexity. Substitutes must be hydrocarbons with roughly similar chemical compositions. Thus, the list of substitute raw materials is limited to coal and biological sources. 6.5.1.1. Coal For the most part, coal is suitable only for the chemical feedstock uses of oil. Although coal is a cheap and abundant raw material, it tends to require more (and more expensive) conversion before it is suitable as a substitute for oil and NGL's. In a nutshell, coal can be converted into most chemicals presently processed from oil and NGL's; however, it is usually much more expensive to do so. The environmental consequences of increased coal extraction are discussed in section 7.l. l. 1., where coal is considered as an altemative fuel for generating electricity.
6.5. 1.2. Biological Products

Products from living biological entities can be used for most non-energy uses of oil and NGL' s. The important thing to understand is that very large quantities of oil and NGL's are used to produce non-energy products. To harvest enough of a biological product to make an important contribution to this industry would require a large-scale production system. Presently, some biological products do compete as feedstocks and for such products as waxes. Soybeans are the most obvious domestic example. The vast acreage committed to soybean production is an example of the kind of commitment that would have to be mounted to substitute for a meaningful percentage of oil and NGL's. The major impediment to such conversion is its cost. Greatly increasing the harvest of biological resources would mean conversion of significant land area to this new use. The result would depend on the biological source and the region chosen to provide that source. Regardless of the option chosen, consequences would almost undoubtedly include: o loss of habitat for many species of wildlife, including those that are threatened and endangered o increased soil erosion o water quality degradation o added dust and related fonns of air pollution o increased use of insecticides, herbicides, and other potentially harmful agricultural chemicals 6.5.2. Using Less of the Products Among the major forms of conservation is using less of the oil-based products. In the case of chemicals, lubricants, etc., this would entail lowering our standard of living. It would mean things like painting our houses less frequently, cutting back on consumption of pharmaceuticals, and not cleaning clothes and houses so often. A major future use of plastics made from oil and NGL's is as lighter-weight major parts for automobiles. Cutting back on plastic parts for automobiles would make the autos heavier, which would expand their need for oil products as fuel. Meaningful reduction of these non-fuel uses would lead to a lower standard of living with

26

questionable positive impacts on the natural and human environments.

6.5.3. Recycling
Plastics are easily recycled although only a small percentage of plastics are recycled in the U.S. Recycling solvents, lubricants, and other oil-based chemicals would also seem to be an ideal way to save some of the raw material input. Unfortunately, used chemicals of these types are often contaminated with dangerous and environmentally damaging materials. Removing these contaminants is often more expensive than the cost of virgin raw materials. For example, recycled motor oil from automobiles has mostly been mixed in with residual oil and burned in boilers. Disposing of the contaminants can lead to processes that add to air and water pollution. Where processes can be developed to reprocess these types of chemicals in an environmentally acceptable manner, the result could be a saving of oil and NGL's with relatively benign environmental consequences.

7. Alternatives to Natural Gas and Their Environmental Impacts
The same five basic ways exist to replace either OCS gas or oil: import, produce onshore, switch fuel, substitute fuel-saving technology, or accept less service. The principal alternatives to OCS natural gas are oil and gas from onshore production. Oil importation and onshore gas production are covered in section 4.3. This section will review the other potential substitutes for OCS gas.

7. 1. Electricity Generation
Electricity generation is the fastest growing use of natural gas. As discussed in section 3.3., natural gas is especially well suited to producing ramping power to meet peak loads . This is the most expensive and valuable type of power production. However, combined-cycle gas plants are finding more frequent application to base-load and intermediate power supply.

7. 1. 1. Alternative Sources of Electricity
Table 7 provides statistics on utilities' capability to generate electricity using different fuels and the amount of electricity generated using the various fuels in 2004.

7.1.1.1. Coal
As table 7 makes clear, the United States generates more electricity using coal than any other fuel. Coal is best suited to base-load and slowly ramping power production because coal-fired power plants are relatively slow to bring on and off line. For the proper application, coal-fired power plants compete reasonably well with other generators. However, in order to be efficient, coal plants must be large. In addition, air pollution control regulations require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment. As a result, building a new coal plant entails a very significant capital investment with interest costs that can become prohibitive if the cost of money rises. Thus, utilities have completed few coal-fired electric generating plants in recent years. Nevertheless, in the face of rising gas prices, utilities are planning the construction of many new

27

coal plants. It remains to be seen whether the plants will be built. Coal extraction may cause especially severe impacts on water resources that are degraded by acidic drainage from active and abandoned mines and by silt from earth movement, which is especially serious in strip and auger mining. Ground water is often polluted or disrupted by coal extraction because coal seams serve as the aquifer in many locations. Coal mining also is associated with air pollution from dust and machinery exhaust. The machinery also produces noise pollution. Coal's impact on visual aesthetics is especially severe because the surface scars from strip mining and the mountainside cuts from auger mining have an especially significant effect on scenic mountain areas.

7. 1. 1.2. Nuclear
Nuclear power plants are almost exclusively used for base-load power production. Although nuclear power was originally promoted as a very cheap form of electricity generation, it has proven to be quite expensive. Providing the margin of safety society expects from a nuclear plant requires safety systems that multiply by several times the cost of building a nuclear plant. Similarly, safe operations cost many times the operating costs originally envisioned. Finally, finding a socially acceptable location for disposing of the spent nuclear fuel cells is much more difficult and expensive than originally expected. In table 7 one can see that nuclear plants have the highest ratio of generation to capacity of any major category of electric generation. Where they are installed, they are usually the base-load workhorses of the utilities ' generation systems. Nonetheless, the lack of any planned nuclear capacity addition demonstrates their prohibitively high costs (EIA 2005). In the next 15 or 20 years many presently operating nuclear units are scheduled for decommissioning. If this occurs on schedule, it will lead to a significant increase in the demand for other forms of electricity 28

generating capacity. Development of ultra-safe standardized units and greater creativity in siting are the keys to an expanded future role for nuclear power plants. Compared with other fonns of large-scale electricity generation, nuclear power has relatively minor environmental impacts. Mine tailings from uranium mining have caused radioactive water pollution in the West, but this is more a result of formerly inadequate regulation or lax enforcement than it is a problem with present production. The tremendous cooling needs of nuclear reactors can lead to abnormal temperature increases in bodies of water used for plant cooling. The size of the containment vessels can also cause visual aesthetic degradation. Recent events have dramatized the vulnerability of nuclear plants to acts of terrorism that could lead to the release of radioactive material. 7. 1. 1.3. Hydroelectric Many of the best hydroelectric sites in the U.S. have already been utilized or set aside for aesthetic reasons. In addition hydroelectric dams in several parts of the country have been breached to provide pathways for anadromous fish and for other environmental purposes. As a result, hydroelectric power won't make a significant contribution to additional domestic electricity generation. Pump storage, which is a method for storing less expensive base-load power from off-peak hours for meeting peak demand, could substitute for some natural gas-fired turbines used for peaking power. Environmental impacts from pump storage facilities tend to be localized and to consist of destruction of wildlife habitat and, in open systems, disruption of stream flows. At this time no pump storage projects are being planned for the United States (ElA 2005). 7. 1. 1.4. Geothermal Geothermal electricity generation is limited by the availability of geothennal resources and the inadequate technology to take advantage of many forms of geothennal energy. Geothennal generating stations may create air pollution, water pollution, and land disturbance. Water discharged by geothennal developments is often highly corrosive and full of rocks (Hazen 1996).

7. 1. 1.5. Biomass
Next to wind and geothermal, biomass makes a larger contribution to U.S. electricity generation than any other non-conventional power source. Most of the biomass burned for power is wood or specific types of waste wood products. Obviously, this power source is dependent on a large supply of low-cost wood. At some point trees must be cut to obtain the wood for generating power with this fonn of biomass. Cutting trees can lead to additional water pollution from soil erosion caused by timber road construction and skidding the fallen trees. Ground without the protection of trees, especially if it is burned, may also be subject to increased erosion. The logging also creates a location unsuitable for wildlife requiring trees for food, cover, and protection. Some of the displaced wildlife could be endangered species. Another source of biomass for power is municipal solid waste. Burning solid waste without 29

creating air and water pollution problems is costly. This means such systems usually cannot compete with other sources of power without sizable subsidies. However, in locations where suitable sites for landfills are becoming inaccessible, subsidies may be appropriate. Some individual solid waste incinerators, for example the Lancaster County (Pennsylvania) Resource Recovery System, can solve the solid waste disposal problem; generate electricity; and produce negligible air, water, and land pollution. Unfortunately, the combination of cost and technical sophistication makes waste to power systems unlikely sources of significant electricity generation in the near future.

7.1.1.6. Wind
The amount of electricity generated by wind power has expanded greatly over the last decade driven in part by significant technological improvements. During 1998 and 1999, 925 megawatts of wind-powered generating capacity were added in the U.S., mostly on Iowa and Minnesota farmland (A WEA 2006). Much of the expansion in wind generating facilities has been fueled by generous subsidies for building and operating these generators. Nevertheless, wind power contributes less than one percent of present-day U.S. electricity generation. The wind power industry projects that wind could provide six percent of U.S . power production, about 24.8 billion kWh, by 2020. A major source of this optimism is the 90 percent drop in wind energy costs over the last 20 years (A WEA 2006). The main problem with wind powered electricity generation is wind availability. Most wind systems only operate 25 percent of the time at 50 percent or less of capacity. The lack of wind constancy causes system stress and difficult voltage regulation. Early problems with noise and interference with television, radio, and other media transmissions have largely been solved through better designs and non-metallic wind vanes (Hazen 1996). Recently, planning has begun on two projects offshore the U.S. coast. One is off Nantucket and the other off Long Island. The relative constancy of winds in these areas and their proximity to areas of high demand were important attractions to the developers. Although some European studies have shown the structures to lead to relatively large areas avoided by sea birds, the environmental impacts have not yet been shown to be significantly negative. However, wind-powered generating equipment must be carefully sited. Construction of the pads and access roads for wind farms located in arid, mountainous country can disturb large areas of sensitive land. The result is greatly increased soil erosion compared with what it would be from more traditional land uses leading to siltation in nearby streams. The Altamont Pass wind resource area in California has been associated with high levels of raptor mortality (Audubon 1991). Thus, wind energy development sites must consider the lot:ations of major migration routes and areas that might funnel birds into the machines. Appalachian wind farms have experienced relatively high numbers of bat deaths. The industry is studying this problem with the hope of remedying the situation in the future. The most modem wind generators are very large and revolve relatively slowly. These slower generators may partially alleviate the impacts to birds that have been noted with older models. Visual aesthetics must also be considered in wind energy siting decision. The crests of ridges and the sides of canyons are often the highlights of scenic areas. Generators in stark relief against the 30

sky could create a devastating loss of aesthetic value to some observers. On the other hand, wind generation equipment may be aesthetically compatible with farmland in the Plain States that have some of the most reliable wind resources in the U.S. Wind generation in shallow waters offshore entails similar technology to that used onshore except that a structure must be built to raise the generating equipment above the level of the water. However, unlike parts of Western Europe, 90 percent of U.S. offshore wind resources lie in deep water. Deep water entails much more elaborate and expensive structures to protect the generators. Estimates of shallow water cost lie in the range of $.08 to $.15 per kwh. Deep-water costs are expected to be double those figures although technological improvements and economies of scale could lower that number significantly. Offshore environmental impacts include visual impacts; noise and vibrations; collisions, habitat dislocation, and navigational disorientation for birds; alterations of natural underwater environments; and impacts on fisheries and marine traffic. Potential siting constraints include water depth, migration routes, shipping lanes, pipelines, and military operations.

7.1.1.7. Solar
Solar energy is converted to electricity primarily through solar thermal or photovoltaic technology. Solar thelmal conversion uses three types of conversion technology: parabolic troughs, parabolic dishes, and heliostatlcentral receiver systems. The parabolic troughs and dishes collect solar energy as part of distributed collection systems that transmit solar heat via a fluid system to a point where the heat creates steam to power a turbine. Heliostats are mirrors mounted on an axis maneuvered by a mechanism that focuses the reflected solar energy on a single receiving point. The energy from many heliostats at the central receiver heats water there to drive a turbine. Although research continues, major breakthroughs in solar thermal conversion have been limited of late (Hazen 1996). Photovoltaic technology on the other hand has been a hotbed of recent technological improvement. Photovoltaics create electricity directly through the activity of solar energy on semiconductors. Cells of the semiconducting material are arrayed on trays that may be stacked to maximize solar capture. Alternatively, the material may be laid out in a thin film that should be relatively inexpensive to manufacture and deploy. Photovoltaic systems are finding increased use as power facilities far from existing power lines. As the cost of photovoltaic cells has declined and their reliability improved, in many cases it has become cheaper to install photovoltaic cells than run a long-distance power line (EREN 2001). For instance, a program has been initiated on the Navajo Indian Reservation to install photovoltaic solar electric generating systems on scattered homesites throughout the reservation (Rushlo 2000). Nevertheless, solar powered electricity remains a high cost alternative. Indeed, the cost for thin film technology for large-scale power production is still based on estimates and models. A relatively reliable study suggested that solar energy costs would have to decline tenfold in order to compete with present commodity electricity costs (Zweibel 1999). It is fair to say that for the foreseeable future solar energy will not make a major contribution to electricity generation because of its cost. MMS is investigating the use of solar energy to produce electricity on the OCS.

31

Photovoltaic electricity generation has virtually no negative environmental impacts in the power production process itself. Production of the equipment may entail environmental degradation associated with the manufacturing process, although this should be localized and controllable. However, if solar thermal power were ever to make a measurable contribution to national electricity generation, vast areas of land would have to be given over to this technology. Although the areas best suited to solar energy tend to be arid and thus fragile, many areas might be flat or on gentle slopes and not especially susceptible to wholesale erosion. Nevertheless, large-scale loss of vegetation and wildlife habitat, soil erosion, and resulting water pollution can be expected from large-scale solar thermal generating facilities. Such facilities could also be aesthetically displeasing.

7.1.1.8. Advanced Technologies
Ocean currents. Submerged turbines similar to wind turbines can extract energy from ocean currents. The system for producing energy from ocean currents would consist of the rotor blade turbine, a generator for converting the rotational energy into electricity, and a means of transporting the electrical current to shore for incorporation into the electrical grid. Problems attendant on this technology include the necessity of maintaining corrosion resistance and prevention of marine growth buildup. Marine current energy is likely to have minimal negative environmental impacts; however, fish, marine mammals, shipping routes, and recreational fishing and diving will need protection. Risks may also be encountered from slowing the current flow by extracting energy . One study suggested that if 10% of the Gulf Stream's energy were extracted near Florida, there could be significant climate changes in northwestern Europe. Wave action. The energy from waves can be captured using a variety of technologies. The cost of energy produced by wave action depends on technological, physical, and economic factors. One study found the cost in areas with relatively high wave energy was in the range of $0.09 to $O.ll /kWh after tax incentives. However, expanded production volume can significantly reduce equipment costs. The eventual cost of wave-generated electricity with mature technologies has been estimated to be competitive with wind-generated electricity. Wave energy may have environmental impacts on marine habitat, lead to releases of toxic hydraulic fluids, cause visual disturbances and noise pollution, and conflict with commercial shipping and recreational boating. Other. Tidal energy and ocean thermal gradients are other potential sources of generating capacity. These sources often rely on relatively unique circumstances to justify their construction. For the most part, these exotic sources lack the potential to make a serious contribution to U.S. electricity supply. In most situations these alternatives are too expensive, lack feasible technology, or both. It is extremely unlikely that any exotic form of electricity generation will make even a one percent contribution to the U.S. electricity supply during the planning period for this program MMS is preparing a separate Programmatic EIS for OCS renewable energy. This document will include an assessment of hydrogen production, solar, wind, current, and wave energy sources. It will assess the technical status, economic viability, and potential environmental impacts of each of these sources on the OCS.

32

7. 1.2. More Efficient Electricity Generation Using more efficient generating equipment to produce the same amount of electricity as now could save a meaningful amount of natural gas and oil. Examples of how this could be done include: o replacing aged equipment with modem conventional equipment o replacing straight turbines with much more fuel efficient combined cycle systems o adopting the next generation of nuclear reactor should they become available o building one of the new generation of coal-fired generating plants such as atmospheric fluidized bed, pressurized fluidized bed, or limestone inj ection The problem is that modern, efficient generating plants are very expensive. Power companies may have trouble justifying the expenditures to their stockholders on a financial basis. Furthermore, state regulatory agencies may be unwilling to allow additions to rates for plant construction while they allow standard rate adjustments for fuel costs. Saving natural gas and oil through more efficient generation would reduce the incidence and risk of all the environmental impacts associated with the natural gas and oil production saved. Some of the conserved resources would have come from the OCS. 7. 1.3. More Efficient and Less Electricity Consumption By using less electricity and by using it more efficiently, the industrial, commercial, and residential sectors could save the fuels used to generate that electricity. These types of savings will be discussed in sections 7.2 and 7.3.

7.2. Industrial Sector Uses
7.2.1. Alternative Fuels The trend in the industrial sector is to switch to natural gas or electricity. This means that other fuels are less suitable for industrial applications, more expensive, or both. Oil is the most likely alternative fuel that most industries would choose as a substitute for natural gas. Impacts from oil production are covered in section 4.3. and the 5-Year Program EIS . 7.2.1.1. Coal Coal can be an effective alternative to natural gas in industrial applications where rapid peaking is not a requirement. However, it is an expensive alternative in all but the largest new applications. Among the characteristics that add to the cost of new coal plants are: o the expense of efficient-sized coal-burning facilities o the need for expensive air pollution control equipment o the expense of transporting and handling coal The environmental impacts associated with coal are covered in section 7.1.1.1 . 7.2. 1.2. Electricity

33

Electricity can be substituted for natural gas (and oil) in many industrial applications. Although electricity tends to be more expensive than the use of a raw fuel, it moves the source of air pollution to another location that may have less stringent pollution control regulations than the industrial site. Furthermore, an electric utility can achieve economies of scale in pollution control that might not be available to the individual firm. The environmental impacts attributable to the generation of electricity are dependent on the fuel used and these are covered in section 7.1.1.

7.2.2. More Efficient Energy Usage
Although the industrial sector as a whole spends a considerable amount of time and money developing methods for using energy more efficiently, opportunities remain for saving vast quantities of energy in the industrial sector. Many consulting firms make it their business to help firms use energy more efficiently, but they tend to help only those firms with high enough levels of inefficiency to pay a portion of efficiency savings to a consultant. Many smaller opportunities for improvements go unaddressed. This is true for the use of natural gas, oil, electricity, and even other energy inputs such as coal. One way firms in the industrial sector can improve their energy efficiency is by adopting stateof-the-art equipment. In many cases, a new process or new space heating and cooling equipment can save enough in energy costs to pay for itself in a reasonably short payback period. Choosing equipment that is the right size in terms of energy efficiency for the task at hand can reap related savmgs. Another way firms can save energy is through improving the energy efficiency of their industrial processes. Although most ""reengineering"" activities in industry are aimed at using labor more efficiently, the same approach can be used to save on the use of energy. Combinations of new processes with new, properly sized equipment can lead to especially significant energy savings. Although some negative environmental impacts may be associated with the production of materials or equipment installed in the process of achieving greater energy efficiency, these impacts tend to be negligible. Thus, improvements in the efficiency with which the industrial sector uses energy are almost entirely beneficial to the environment.

7.3. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
7.3. 1. Alternative Fuels
Just as in the industrial sector, the trend in the residential and commercial sectors is to switch to natural gas, when it is available, or electricity. Residential and commercial facilities have relatively many alternative fuel options.

7.3.1.1 Electricity
When gas is unavailable, electricity is the fuel of choice for new residential and commercial facilities in all but the coldest parts of the country. Heat pumps are the technological breakthrough that has allowed electricity to compete with products made from oil. Environmental impacts from the production of electricity are covered in section 7.1. 34

7.3.1.2. Oil

Among the products made from oil and available to the residential and commercial sectors are fuel oil, kerosene, and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Each of these products can be competitive with natural gas under certain circumstances, the most common of which is expensive access to a natural gas pipeline. Oil-based products are also well suited to areas where it is too cold for electric heat pumps to operate effectively. Impacts from oil production are covered in section 4.3. of this paper and in the 5-Year Program EIS.
7.3.1.3. Coal

Coal is still burned in many older houses. Even in modem houses, coal is still used as an auxiliary source of heat, sometimes switching off with wood depending on relative costs or availability. The environmental impacts associated with coal mining are enumerated in section
7.1.1.1.

7.3.1.4. Biomass (Wood)

Wood is burned for heat in many houses. Cutting firewood in moderation may cause little negative environmental impact and may even serve to open up forests to let the remaining trees develop and to provide some ecological diversity. Where such cutting is carried to an extreme it may destroy forest habitat and lead to soil erosion resulting in long-term damage to the land and waters. In addition, habitat for tree-dependent wildlife may be lost with resultant loss of the wildlife population, which may include endangered species. Other forms ofbiolhass can be burned or they can be processed into methane gas for use in a similar manner to natural gas although these alternatives see little application in the residential and commercial sectors.

7.3. 1.5. Solar
Solar energy is almost exclusively an auxiliary source of heat to the residential and commercial sectors. However, especially in sunny areas, the contribution of solar energy can be significant. Simple approaches to letting the sun warm parts of a dwelling, especially those made of heat retaining materials, work especially well. Such passive solar systems can reduce heating bills as much as 50 percent (EREN 2001). Solar energy also works effectively as an auxiliary water heating system. A typical solar water heating system will reduce the need for conventional water heating by two-thirds (EREN 2001). The problem is that these auxiliary systems need a main or a backup system including an alternative source of energy. Where the alternative source is electricity, the demand during times of low solar radiation could force electric utilities to provide relatively expensive peak demand at a cost to all customers whether or not they used solar heat. Recently , photovoltaics for residential and commercial applications have come on the market that can compete with other sources of energy in certain situations. The use of photo voltaic films has been a major breakthrough in helping to make these systems more economical. The solar powered systems still need expensive and complex storage systems or connections to the electric power grid.

35

Manufacturing solar energy capturing material could lead to environmental deterioration; however, that environmental cost is likely to be minor. Environmental impacts of residential and commercial solar energy use at the point of capture are likely to be negligible.

7.3.2. More Efficient Energy Usage
As is true of the industrial sector, the residential and commercial sectors can use correctly sized state-of-the-aIt equipment to increase the efficiency of their energy usage . However, in terms of more efficient use, these sectors have some specific steps open to them that have broad application across the sectors. Most important is the use of better designs and materials. Better designs can take advantage of passive solar energy, minimize openings to the outside, and take into account airflow as well as temperature to maximize comfort. Better materials include multipaned glass, insulated sheathing, and more effective insulation materials. Insulation and weatherization can be especially effective in the residential sector. Programs to subsidize insulation and weatherization sponsored by electric utilities have cost-effectively spared the utilities from having to install expensive new generating plants. In more sophisticated applications, zoning and time-of-day controls can be used to hold down unnecessary energy usage in large residences and commercial establishments. More efficient appliances and appliance usage can also add to the efficiency of the residential sector. Any negative environmental impacts from increased production of more energy efficient heating and cooling equipment and appliances would be only marginal. Therefore, almost all the improvements in energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors would have positive impacts on the natural environment.

7.3.3. Less Energy Usage
In the industrial sector, any decrease in energy usage not associated with increased energy efficiency would lead directly to a decrease in production. In the residential sector, less energy usage might lead to lower utility; however, the tradeoff might be a reasonable one. For instance, less heating and cooling might lead people to change their dress habits without causing much inconvenience. Everyday decisions like this could lead to positive impacts on the natural environment.

8. A Note on ""Conservation""
The two types of energy conservation, substituting energy-saving technology and using less of the energy service, share two important characteristics: 1. There may be some negative environmental impacts associated with any new equipment required to achieve the efficiency, but these impacts will tend to be marginal. 2. The net effect of these measures will generally be positive from an environmental point of view, even though they could lead to unintended consequences. Furthermore, there is ample opportunity in our society to provide cost-effective subsidies to
36

entice people to implement various conservation measures. However, for any given level of technology the opportunities are not unlimited. Enticement to conserve will have to be constant. After an initial period of success, each additional unit of conservation at a given technological level will become incrementally more expensive. In other words, absent technological change, conservation has an upward sloping supply curve just as most other goods and services do. Thus, our society could decide to save energy and save money in the process, but only for a while. Eventually, saving more energy would become too expensive to continue, unless breakthrough technology can come to the rescue. Some energy analysts believe that society has within its power the ability to implement technological improvements that could change the nature of our energy system. The Rocky Mow1tain Institute has published a volume titled, Winning the Oil Endgame, in which the authors detail just such a system of change based partially on already available technology and partially on technological improvements that they believe are well within the capabilities of modern science and engineering. Their focus is on substituting conservation and other fuel sources for the vast quantity of oil imported by the U.S. from unstable foreign sources. They offer the possibility of achieving these goals in the not too distant future (Lovins 2006).

9. Conclusion
In the short run, oil and natural gas are essential elements in the U.S. energy equation. Within the next few years, even vigorous government action can only shift the mix of energy alternatives to a minor degree. Any major change in the energy mix will also require changes in behavior by individuals and institutions not under direct control of the government in the U.S. system. In an intermediate time period, other energy options like wind powered electricity generation and hybrid-electric cars can begin to make inroads on hydrocarbon use if government gives these alternatives a sufficient boost. In the longer run, new generation nuclear electricity generation and fuel cell powered transportation could revolutionize the energy picture. These long run possibilities won't come to pass until most of the development associated with the present 5-Year Program has peaked out and been decommissioned . Until such a time as the U.S . economy can rely on alternatives with less serious environmental impacts, especially in the area of greenhouse gases, oil and natural gas will remain key interim fuels. Even in the foreseeable future, oil will be needed to power airplanes, to provide heat in cold rural locations, and for non-energy uses. Natural gas will likely still be the fuel of choice for peaking electric power. Alternatives likely to help minimize environmental impacts in the long run are topped by conservation, the least polluting, most cost-effective option up to a point. However, without revolutionary technological changes, conservation benefits are limited, as noted in section 8 of this paper. Other comers include hybrid cars and fuel cells in the ground transportation sector. New generation nuclear backed up with wind may power baseload electricity. Finally, hydrogen for urban industrial, commercial, and residential heating and related uses rounds out the list of potential minimum polluters likely to populate the energy economy. Oil and natural gas will be needed in the interim to power an economy that can generate the capital needed to implement these less polluting alternatives. The most likely and largest available alternatives to oes production are imported oil and LNG. The environmental impacts associated with these

Steve, the following is in response to questions from your reading of the DPP. Julie Fleming has begun a 2-year assignment as MMS's liaison to the Assistant Secretary's office. Cheri Hunter, from the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Program, has agreed to help us out in our office over the next few months while we hire a new legislative specialist. Please contact Cheri or me if you have any questions concerning the offshore program.

MMS Response to DPP Questions:

On page 7, it says that ""the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars."" Steve didn't see that number split out anywhere in the report (after flipping through to the end), so could MMS break that down ... how much of that is taxes, and how much is profits?
Answer: The sum of Federal corporate taxes and corporate net income generated by the new program is forecasted to be $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 million in present value dollars. The break-down of these measures is, for the nominal dollar case, approximately $400 billion in taxes and $700 billion in net profits. In the present value dollar case, MMS estimates about $50 billion is in taxes and $80 billion in corporate profits.

On page 23, there's a reference to the 1997 MMS cumulative effects report, which is a fulfillment of the OCSLA Section 20(e) requirement that MMS report to Congress on cumulative effects every three years. Have there been more recent cumulative effects reports, and if not, why not?
Answer: The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66), Section 3003 terminated the requirement of submittal of the Report on Effects of Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Activities on Human, Marine, and Coastal Environments under section 20(e) of the oes Lands Act (see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104 cong public laws&docid=f:pubI66.104.pdf). The last report required by OeSLA Section 20(e) was published in 1997 and was entitled Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Natural Gas Resource Management Program: Cumulative Effects 1992-1994, oes Report MMS 97-0027. You may download a copy of the report at http://www.mms.gov/itd/hdqrspubs.htm.

On page 25, it mentions a lawsuit against the 2007 5-year plan. Could we get copies of the filings to date and information on status of that lawsuit?
Answer: Solicitor's Office is providing copies and the documents will be delivered to you by February 20.

On page 78, there's a reference to the report, ""Energy Alternatives and the Environment"". The link to this report on the 2007-2012 5-yr program page apparently is broken. Can we get him an electronic copy of that report?
Answer: The link has been fixed on mms.gov. Electronic file attached.

Can we get a map with indications of the distance from the FL coast of the various parts of that DPP area (both the area with proposed full leasing and the area that has the no permanent structure buffer)?
Answer: See attached maps in two formats with contour lines at 25-mile intervals.

On page 90; Table 5 - presents resource estimates by PA for all ""unleased, undiscovered, economically recoverable resources."" Can we provide the UERR for the ""leased"" resources?
Answer: Excel spreadsheet attached.

On page 93194; the DPP talks about the OECM model for estimating environmental and social costs associated with OCS activities. Can we provide the data ""inputs""?
Answer: The inputs to the model are Exploration and Development (E&D) scenarios and Production Profiles prepared inhouse. MMS considers this information as privileged.

Can we provide information on the recent contract for the Mid-Atlantic study?
10/512010

Page 3 of 3

Answer: This study consists of a data search and synthesis of existing environmental and socioeconomic information for the northern and central Atlantic area. An evaluation will be made of the relative contributions of physical oceanographic processes to crossshelf transport, as well as the contributions of buoyancy and meteorological forcing to seawater transport. We expect the report to be completed in late 2009. For more information you can go to the website at http://www .gom r. mms.gov/homepg/regu late/environ/ongoing studies/gm/G M-0702.html

Steve, this is in response to your Feb 10, follow-up with Julie Fleming asking if ""MMS only updates their reserve assessments in the GOM when they put out a whole new inventory? It's not something that you keep track as companies report production and additions to reserves?"" Reserves (not Undiscovered Resources) are updated daily by MMS in the Field-Reservoir-Reserves-Estimates database in the MMS Technical Information Management System database (TIMS). These updates are done as companies report new production and drill and complete new wells. The updated Reserve Estimates are compiled into reports called ""Estimated Oil and Gas Reserves Report,"" published on the MMS/GOMR web page. http://www.qomr.mms.gov/homepg/pubinfo/freeasci/geologic/freegeol.html Undiscovered Resources are generally updated only upon completion of a new assessment.

Thanks very much, Lyn! This is extremely helpful. But, naturally, leads to another request - could we get Table 5 and the spreadsheet you just sent for the UTRR in the leased areas? So, basically, I'm just asking how much of the UTRR in the 6 leaseable planning areas is leased, and how much is unleased. And could we also get new figures for the attached table, which is for the 2007-2012 plan , but using the 2010-2015 DPP? Let me know if that request was a little unclear. Thanks, --Steve

Ellen, Joan and John, the minority staff of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources has requested a couple photos for use at the upcoming OCS hearing. They have requested and we will provide them with a copy of the attached old photo of the wooden platforms along the pier at the Summerland field, Santa Barbara. They have asked if we can provide them with a ""modern"" photo of the same site. And if not of the exact site, a photo looking out from onshore Santa Barbara. I do have the photo of platfonn Grace we used for the MMS hallway, but I'm wondering if there are other, more ""vista"" photos of the area versus just one platform? I'm thinking that in addition to other Santa Barbara photos you may have, we might provide the Grace photo along with the underwater marine life photos. I'd like to get back with the committee staff by COB Monday to let them know what we can or cannot provide. Thank you,

Jamie, The 101.3 billion barrels (""total endowment"" less ""cumulative production"", as you calculated) represents MMS's estimates of discovered and undiscovered resources. ""Resources"" is a more appropriate term than ""Reserves"" in this case .... You could call the 101.3 billion barrels ""untapped Federal OCS oil resources"" (keep in mind this excludes state waters). Just for clarification, you would not technically call these ""reserves"" since they include both undiscovered resources and discovered resources. Reserves are by definition discovered, economic, and have an associated development project attached to them. They are the category of resources known with the greatest certainty. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Cheri

Jamie, The 101.3 billion barrels (""total endowment"" less ""cumulative production"", as you calculated) represents MMS's estimates of discovered and undiscovered resources. ""Resources"" is a more appropriate term than ""Reserves"" in this Case .... You could call the 101.3 billion barrels ""untapped Federal oes oil resources"" (keep in mind this excludes state waters). Just for clarification, you would not technically call these ""reserves"" since they include both undiscovered resources and discovered resources. Reserves are by definition discovered, economic, and have an associated development project attached to them. They are the category of resources known with the greatest certainty. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Cheri

Cheri, As we discussed, I am looking for a clarification as to whether I can use the ""total endowment"" number that MMS came up with in 2006 i.e. Reserves + reserves appreciation + mean undiscovered resources = 101.3 billion barrels total for untapped offshore oil reserves, or is it just the 85.88 billion barrels. Thanks for your clarification.

Securing Ocean Energy & Economic Value For America

Planning Area Resources Addendum to Assessment of Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Oil and Gas Resources of the Nation's Outer Continental Shelf, 2006

Figure 1. Federal oes Plarming Areas.

his report is an addendum to MMS Fact Sheet RED-200601 (Assessment o/Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Oil and Gas Resources 0/ the Nation s Outer Continental Shelf, 2006), and it summarizes the planning area level technically recoverable oil and gas resources for the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) (see Figure 1). The OCS comprises that portion of the submerged seabed whose mineral estate is subject to Federal jurisdiction. Planning areas are administrative subdivisions of the OCS used in the Department ofInterior's offshore oil and gas leasing program. Planning area boundaries were redefined in 2006, and therefore the planning area level results of this study are not directly comparable with previous MMS resource assessments. The 2006 assessment represents a comprehensive appraisal that considered relevant data and information available as of January 1,2003, incorporated advances in petroleum exploration and development technologies, and employed new methods of resource assessment.

T

percent probability (a 19 in 20 chance) and a 5-percent probability (a 1 in 20 chance) of there being more than those amounts present, respectively. The 95- and 5-percent probabilities are considered reasonable minimum and maximum values, and the mean is the average or expected value. Estimates ofUERR are presented for three discrete oil/gas price pairs, $46lbbl and $6.96/Mcf, $60lbbl and $9.07/Mcf, and $80/bbl and $12.10/Mcfrespectively. They are based on mean resource values and the oil/gas price pairs are not independent of each other; that is, one specific oil price cannot be used to obtain an oil resource estimate and a separate gas price used to obtain a gas resource estimate. The gas price is dependent on the oil price .and must be used in conjunction with the oil price to calculate resources. The reason for this condition is that oil and gas frequently occur together and the individual pool economics are calculated using the coupled pricing. A different gas price associated with the oil price would result in a different resource number than that shown in the table. For further information on this study, please refer to MMS Fact Sheet RED-2006-01 or contact Gary Lore at 703-7871628 or gary.lore@mms.gov. Supporting geological studies, previous assessment results, and methodologies used by MMS for resource assessment can be found on MMS's web site, www.mms.govlofJshore.
MMS Fact Sheet RED-2006-02 July 2006

This assessment provides estimates of the undiscovered, recoverable oil and natural gas resources located outside of known oil and gas fields on the OCS. Estimates of undiscovered recoverable resources are presented in two categories, undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR), and undiscovered economically recoverable resources (UERR) (see Table 1). UTRR estimates are presented at 95 th and 5th percentile levels, as well as the mean estimate. This range of estimates corresponds to a 95u.s. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service

MMS Fast Facts
September 2008 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Resources by Water Depth
Congress has been considering many proposals regarding oil and gas leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has received many requests for information regarding OCS resource assessments and the location of those resources in relation to the distance from the coastline. In response to these numerous requests the MMS has published several new illustrations that can be found on our website. These illustrations, one for each OCS Planning Area in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Eastern Gulf of Mexico; depict the Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Resources (UTRR) by water depth and are based on the MMS 2006 OCS oil and gas assessment data. MMS does not have UTRR data specific to distance from shore. However, lines showing distance from shore have been drawn on the illustration for purely reference purposes only to show the most common mileage increments included in recent legislative proposals. The UTRR numbers have no direct correlation to the distance from shore. The new illustrations include the following Planning Areas and can be found at: http://www.mms.gov/revaldivlNatAssessmentMap.htm Oregon-Washington Northern California Central California Southern California Eastern Gulf of Mexico Straits of Florida South Atlantic Mid Atlantic North Atlantic Other Resource Assessment information, including the source for the UTRR data can be found at: http://www.mms.gov/revaldivlRedNatAssessment.htm For past editions of MMS Fast Facts, visit http://www.mms.gov/ooc/newweb/congressionalaffairs/congress.htm.

Thanks very much, Lyn! This is extremely helpful. But, naturally, leads to another request - could we get Table 5 and the spreadsheet you just sent for the UTRR in the leased areas? So, basically, I'm just asking how much of the UTRR in the 6 leaseable planning areas is leased, and how much is unleased. And could we also get new figures for the attached table, which is for the 2007-2012 plan, but using the 2010-2015 OPP? Let me know if that request was a little unclear. Thanks, --Steve

MMS Response to DPP Questions:

On page 7, it says that ""the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars."" Steve didn't see that number split out anywhere in the report (after flipping through to the end), so could MMS break that down ... how much of that is taxes, and how much is profits?
Answer: The sum of Federal corporate taxes and corporate net income generated by the new program is forecasted to be $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 million in present value dollars. The break-down of these measures is, for the nominal dollar case, approximately $400 billion in taxes and $700 billion in net profits. In the present value dollar case, MMS estimates about $50 billion is in taxes and $80 billion in corporate profits.

On page 23, there's a reference to the 1997 MMS cumulative effects report, which is a fulfillment of the OCSLA Section 20(e) requirement that MMS report to Congress on cumUlative effects every three years. Have there been more recent cumulative effects reports, and if not, why not?
Answer: The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66), Section 3003 terminated the requirement of submittal of the Report on Effects of Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Activities on Human, Marine, and Coastal Environments under section 20(e) of the OCS Lands Act (see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-

bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104 cong public laws&docid=f:pubI66.104.pdf). The last report required by OeSLA Section 20(e) was published in 1997 and was entitled Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Natural Gas Resource Management Program: Cumulative Effects 1992-1994, oes Report MMS 97-0027. You may download a copy of the report at http://www.mms.gov/itd/hdqrspubs.htm.

On page 25, it mentions a lawsuit against the 2007 5-year plan. Could we get copies of the filings to date and information on status of that lawsuit?
Answer: Solicitor's Office is providing copies and the documents will be delivered to you by February 20.

On page 78, there's a reference to the report, ""Energy Alternatives and the Environment"". The link to this report on the 2007-2012 5-yr program page apparently is broken. Can we get him an electronic copy of that report?
Answer: The link has been fixed on mms.gov. Electronic file attached.

Can we get a map with indications of the distance from the FL coast of the various parts of that DPP area (both the area with proposed full leasing and the area that has the no permanent structure buffer)?
Answer: See attached maps in two formats with contour lines at 25-mile intervals.

On page 90; Table 5 - presents resource estimates by PA for all ""unleased, undiscovered, economically recoverable resources."" Can we provide the UERR for the ""leased"" resources?
Answer: Excel spreadsheet attached.

On page 93/94; the DPP talks about the OECM model for estimating environmental and social costs associated with OCS activities. Can we provide the data ""inputs""?
Answer: The inputs to the model are Exploration and Development (E&D) scenarios and Production Profiles prepared inhouse. MMS considers this information as privileged.

Can we provide information on the recent contract for the Mid-Atlantic study?
Answer: This study consists of a data search and synthesis of existing environmental and socioeconomic information for the northern and central Atlantic area. An evaluation will be made of the relative contributions of physical oceanographic processes to crossshelf transport, as well as the contributions of buoyancy and meteorological forcing to seawater transport. We expect the report to be completed in late 2009. For more information you can go to the website at http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/ongoing studies/gm/GM-0702.html

The Honorable Todd Tiahrt House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Congressman Tiahrt: Thank you for your letter dated January 15,2009, concerning one of your constituents Mr. Kelley Edgar, President of KanOkla Oil and Gas Corporation (KanOkla). The Minerals Management Service (MMS) issued an interest invoice to KanOkla. When KanOkla did not pay this invoice, it was referred to the Department of Treasury (Treasury) for collection in accordance with the Debt Collection Act. Mr. Edgar has stated that he sold his interest in the properties associated with the invoice in December 2005, to Striker Petroleum (Striker) and KanOkla does not owe this debt. However, the interest invoice involves late paid royalties and invoices for months prior to KanOkla's December 2005 sale to Striker. Therefore, KanOkla does owe this debt. The MMS staff contacted Mr. Edgar and explained the situation. Mr. Edgar acknowledged that KanOkla does owe this debt and that the payment will be sent. Mr. Edgar disagrees with the additional fines and penalties assessed by Treasury; however, once a debt is referred to Treasury, those charges are incurred and MMS has no authority to waive these charges. If I can be of further assistance, please call me at 202-208-3500 or call Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS, Office of Congressional Affairs, at 202-208-3502. Sincerely,

Subject: FW: Question re differences between MMS and EIA number

Steve, in response to your question re the different EIA and MMS GaM proven reserve numbers, we offer the following information about EIA reserves reporting and our Resource Evaluation Division's explanation of MMS' reserve estimates and latest data. Estimates of proved reserves are not fixed, will change over time with revisions and increase as new field discoveries are reported and decrease as reserves are produced. Therefore, the estimate of proved reserves will first depend on the date the estimate was made. The MMS estimate Mr. Felgus cites (7.06 Bbbls of oil) for Gulf of Mexico Reserves probably came from Table 1(a) of the Inventory Report which consists of both Remaining Proved Oil Reserves of 5.71 Billion Bbls and 1.35 Billion Bbls of Unproved Reserves as of December 31 st, 2002. (Generally, the unproved reserves are not added to proved reserves because of different levels of economic certainty and hydrocarbon assurance. However, MMS combined these estimates for the purposes of the Inventory report. ) The EIA estimate of 5 Billion Bbls appears to consist only of remaining Proved Oil Reserves. EIA would need to confirm the source of their 5 Bbbls--this may be an unpublished update of their 2007 estimate? ** MMS's report of remaining Proved Oil Reserves estimated 4.82 Billion Bbls as of December 31 st, 2004. http://www.gomr.mms.gov/PDFs/2008/2008-034.pdf EIA compiles information reported to them by industry. MMS estimates come from independent interpretation of the data and are used to support our Fair Market Value determinations. MMS works with EIA on major differences between MMS' field level data and the company reported data that EIA collects, usually yearly. In summary, the difference in these estimates appear to lie in how estimates of Unproved Reserves were accounted for in the reports and the time period the estimates are made.

** EIA's annual estimates can be found at either:

The information below relates to the three items you requested. 1. The current status of negotiations between the Department and the. 45 companies holding 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds; a list which shows the companies that have agreed to renegotiate their leases; and the percent of the overall revenue loss that the Department attributes to each company. Currently, there are 43 companies that have record title or operating rights interest in the 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds. While we have had at least preliminary discussions with all companies that have held or currently hold significant interests, most companies appear to be waiting to see the outcome of the Kerr-McGee litigation. This Administration will continue to work with Congress to reach an appropriate resolution of this issue. The Department reached agreements with six companies (Enclosure 1), and they have been paying royalties consistent with the tenns of the agreements. Enclosure 2 provides an update on the amount and percentage, attributed to each company, of royalties that would have been paid through December 31, 2008, if price thresholds had applied to these leases. Please note that there are some differences between Enclosures 1 and 2 because the 43 companies listed in Enclosure 1 are current lessees of record title in the 1998 and 1999 leases, whereas, the companies listed in Enclosure 2 are companies with operating rights ownership in those 1998 and 1999 leases that have been or are currently in a producing status. Under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996, companies that are designated operators are primarily liable for royalty payments once leases are in producing status. 2. The current status of the Kerr-McGee legal challenge to the Department's authority to place price thresholds on any deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000; the anticipated resolution date for the case; and the Department's view on congressional legislation reaffirming the Department's authority to place price thresholds. On January 12,2009, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion upholding the District Court and ruling in favor of Kerr-McGee. The Department of Justice is considering the Department's

2

recommendation that a motion be filed requesting the Fifth Circuit reconsider this ruling en bane.

3. The current status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been foregone
on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases, and estimates of future foregone royalties from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases and future royalties that may be at risk from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until these issues are resolved; and the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until the Kerr-McGee suit is resolved. As requested, Enclosure 3 provides an update on the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been forgone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases as of December 31, 2008. Enclosure 4 outlines the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases. The annual amount of royalties increased from $1.1 billion in our February 4, 2008, letter to $1.5 billion to date. We will update these figures annually. Enclosure Sa provides a range of estimates, as of January 1,2009, for future royalties from 1996, 1997, and 2000 D WRRA leases that may be at risk due to the KerrMcGee litigation and Enclosure 5b provides estimates of future production and royalty value from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases. The estimates range from $18 billion to $19.0 billion and $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion in current year dollars, respectively. We will continue to send you updates as new information becomes available. A copy of this letter is being sent to all Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Members. Should you or your staff have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by phone at (202) 208-6734.

Attachments: Fenstein Letter 3-09-09.pdf

The attached letter from the Department of the Interior's Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, is the 2nd update to Chairman Feinstein's original April 18, 2007, request for information regarding oil and gas royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA). The update provides information on Gulf of Mexico OCS leases issued with deep water royalty relief in 1996 through 2000, including leases that were issued in 1998 and 1999 without prices thresholds and on leases issued in 1996, 1997 and 2000 which are the subject of the Kerr-McGee lawsuit, challenging the Secretary' s authority under the DWRRA to set price thresholds for leases issued in 19962000.

Subject: Status on Alabama ClAP plan Jon, It was a pleasure speaking with you today. Per your request for an update on the State's ClAP plan submission: The State submitted its revised Plan January 26, 2009. The MMS completed its review and determined that 2 projects did not meet an authorized use criteria. An email informing the State of these comments was sent February 25, 2009. The State had 10 working days (March 11, 2009) to modify and submit a final version of the Plan; the State sent a final Plan on March 6, 2009. The MMS is completing its review of the changes in the final Plan and anticipates submitting an approval package around March 16th. The MMS intends to move the plan through headquarters review and, presuming there are no additional problems, to the Acting Director for signature in 6 to 8 weeks.

Subject: RE: Status on Alabama ClAP plan
Hi Jon, Following our phone call yesterday, I am providing a little additional information at your request. 1. The State Plan that was received by the MMS Gulf of Mexico Region on March 6 does not contain the 2 projects. The projects that were removed can be submitted at a later time. Whether or not public participation will be required will depend on the manner in which the projects are resubmitted. MMS coordinates quite closely with the State ClAP leads in advising on these processes. The Region anticipates submitting an approval package to MMS Headquarters by March 16. MMS has made a concerted effort to minimize the subsequent review/signature time, the 6 to 8 weeks includes approvals through all of the required authorities.

2.

My apologies for not being able to gjve you a call during normal working hours today, I wanted to send an email to let you know that we didn't forget about you. I'd be happy to discuss with you tomorrow if you would like, send me a reply if you would like to discuss further. Thanks, Cheri

As I mentioned, the number of platforms on the OCS: Gulf of Mexico 3,772 Pacific Region 23 TotalOCS 3,795 The attachment contains the number of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico Region. There are no rigs in the Alaska Region. In the Pacific, there are no Mobil Drilling Units, although there are drilling rigs on the platforms to perform development drilling or workovers.

Subject: FW: Hearing on 24th

This is to follow up on my discussion last week with Steve and the recent reports of the upcoming joint Subcommittee hearing focused on the environmental affects of OCS development. As you are aware, the OCS Lands Act authorized MMS's Environmental Studies Program (ESP) as a means to gather and synthesis environmental, social and economic science information. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy report, ""An Ocean Blueprint for the 21 st Century,"" identifies the MMS ESP ""as a major source of information about the impacts of OCS oil and gas activities on the human, marine, and coastal environments."" . The Minerals Management Service's (MMS) environmental programs directly support informed decision-making on energy and non-energy mineral planning and development activities for the OCS . MMS is involved in all phases of OCS activity, providing comprehensive environmental analyses, environmental policy guidance, direction, and program oversight for the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management program. Key functions performed by the MMS Environmental Division include: o Evaluating and analyzing environmental data necessary to prepare program-level and site specific National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and OCS Lands Act reports. o Providing scientific and technical information to support decisions needed to avoid potential environmental effects of offshore energy and marine mineral resource development. o Collecting and making available to the public information needed to analyze, discuss, and guide future decisions pertaining to lease sales and exploration, development, and production activities. o Developing, implementing, and assessing environmental monitoring efforts to determine the extent and duration of environmental effects and potential mitigation measures that can be used to minimize impacts. o Providing oversight, policy guidance, and direction for NEPA and other environmental laws and regulations affecting OCS activities; and participates in international conventions and treaty activities. o Administering grants funds identified by Congress to be used to protect, conserve or restore the natural coastal environment and to mitigate impacts from offshore oil and gas activities. o Assessing conformity with environmental legal mandates and regulations (e.g. the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act). With our $800 million in studies designed to ensure sound steward and protection of the ocean environmental, MMS' s Environmental Studies Program provides support to the decision-making concerning the offshore program. The ESP has 3 general goals: o assess and manage environmental impacts, o predict potential impacts on marine life from chronic, low-level pollution or large spills; and o monitor human, marine, and coastal environments. These studies have provided significant advances in knowledge regarding marine mammals, deep water currents, and the ecology and significance of the largest artificial reef system in the world created by the

oil and gas platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, these studies have resulted in discoveries such as a new species of polychaete worms, fondly known as ""ice worms,"" that actually live on the outcrops of frozen methane hydrates that occur in deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The MMS has expanded the scope of the ESP to meet information needs for the management of the OCS Sand and Gravel program, and has begun acquiring information relevant to the OCS Alternative Energy program focusing on renewable energy projects including wind, wave, and ocean currents. MMS also conducts research in physical oceanography that focuses on understanding and verifying general physical processes and features common to the OCS The MMS is the principal US federal agency responsible for oil spill response research to fulfill oil spill regulatory responsibilities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OP A 90). Responsibility to manage the National Oil Spill Response Facility ""Ohmsett"" came from OPA 90 and funding for operation and maintenance costs of the facility are covered by the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. For more than 25 years, MMS has maintained a comprehensive, long-term research program to improve oil spill response technologies. The major focus of the program is to improve the knowledge and technologies used for the detection, containment and cleanup of oil spills that may occur on the OCS. The Ohmsett facility provides oil spill response testing, training, and research opportunities to government, industry, academia, and private organizations on a reimbursable basis. Ohmsett is the only facility that can test full sized oil spill response equipment with a variety of crude oils and refined petroleum products under reproducible marine conditions. MMS engages academia, industry, non-government organizations, Federal, State, and local governments outside entities in the development of a research plan for the ESP. The studies are sponsored through a competitive procurement process, cooperative agreements with State institutions and universities, and interagency agreements with other Federal Agencies. Due to the interest in study results, MMS established the Environmental Studies Program Information System (ESPIS) to provide easy access to completed studies. ESPIS can be accessed through the MMS website at: https://www.gornr.mms.gov /homepg/espis/espismaster.asp ?appid= 1. I wanted to bring to your attention to the scope of MMS' s environmental studies program. To assist the subcommittee, MMS would be pleased to offer our assistance in providing the names of distinguished subject matter experts who are familiar with the environmental issues surrounding the OCS program.

National Environmental Policy Act Compliance for Geological and Geophysical Activity on the Atlantic OCS
Purpose An environmental impact statement (EIS) is proposed in light of the multiple geological and geophysical (G&G) permits submitted to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) for the Outer Continental Sh(;!lf (OCS) waters of the Atlantic. This EIS will evaluate the environmental impacts of these proposed G&G activities. No National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) programmatic documents have been performed for G&G activities in the Atlantic OCS. Previous NEP A programmatic documents for G&G activities in the Gulf of Mexico have been performed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals A Management Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Geological Survey. The EIS proposed for the Atlantic may now be necessary not only because of the multiple permits received by MMS but also because of industry's expressed interest in expanding activities into the Atlantic offshore waters. This EIS will also review advances in G&G technology and improved knowledge of acoustic impacts on marine life. This EIS will determine whether significant impacts to Atlantic resources could occur as a result of G&G activities and, where needed, outline mitigation and monitoring measures that will reduce or eliminate the potential for impacts to the environment. National Environmental Policy Act Compliance The NEPA of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) is the foundation of environmental policymaking in the United States. The NEP A process is intended to help public officials make decisions based on an understanding of environmental consequences and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment. The NEP A established two primary mechanisms for this purpose: (1) The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was established to advise agencies on the environmental decisionmaking process and to oversee and coordinate the development of Federal environmental policy. (2) Agencies must include an environmental review process early in the planning for proposed actions.

The CEQ issued regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508) in 1978 implementing NEP A. The regulations include procedures to be used by Federal agencies for the environmental review process. Refer to the following CEQ NEP Anet website for additional guidance for implementing NEPA and for links to other websites dealing with environmental impact assessment: http://www.mms.gov/eppd/compliance/nepa/index.htm. In accordance with NEP A, MMS prepares environmental documents on various actions related to offshore energy and mineral collection activities. These documents may be environmental assessments or EIS's, depending on the nature of the action in question or the significance of potential impacts associated with the action. It is the MMS's policy to involve the public in preparing and implementing its NEPA procedures.

Compliance with the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act for Geological and Geophysical Activities on the Atlantic OCS
How would we comply with the Endangered Species Act?
Section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that all Federal agencies consult with the Secretary of Commerce or Interior (via the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) or the u.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)) to ensure that any ""agency action"" is not likely to

Photo : NOAA (www.nmfs.gov).

(1) jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or (2) result in the destruction or adverse modification of an endangered or threatened species' critical habitat. Any proposed geological and geophysical (G&G) activity on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf that may affect or take a listed species or designated critical habitat whether the effects are beneficial, adverse, direct, or indirect, will require consultation with NMFS and FWS. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) will initiate this consultation with a Biological Assessment, or similar document, containing a thorough analysis of potential effects to ESAlisted species and designated critical habitat, a review of the best available relevant information, and any details on measures meant to minimize or eliminate the potential for effects to occur. The NMFS and FWS will review this information, consult with MMS, and then issue a Biological Opinion on whether the proposed action is likely to adversely affect or jeopardize the continued existence of the species or adversely modify critical habitat. This opinion will also include (1)"" an analysis of cumulative effects; (2) reasonable and prudent alternatives (if a jeopardy conclusion is reached); (3) an Incidental Take Statement (ITS) authorizing, under specific conditions, the taking of ESA-listed species; and (4) any required or recommended measures to reduce the amount or potential for incidental take. The ITS will not be issued for ESA-listed marine mammals until an authorization is obtained under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (see below). The Federal regulations implementing Section 7(a) are found at 50 CFR 402 (Interagency Cooperation - Endangered Species Act of 1973, as Amended). In addition, NMFS and FWS jointly issued an Endangered Species Consultation Handbook that addresses the major consultation processes, including informal, formal, emergency, and special consultations, and conferences. A more in-depth description of this consultation process may be found at the following MMS website: http://www.mms.gov/eppd/compliance/esa/consultations.htm.

How would we comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act?

Congress enacted the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) in 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361-1407). The MMPA prohibits (with some exceptions) (1) the ""taking"" of marine mammals in U.S. waters and by any person under U.S . jurisdiction on the high seas and (2) importing marine mammals and marine mammal products into the U.S. ""Take"" is statutorily defined as ""to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture or kill any marine mammal."" The 1994 Amendments to the MMP A further define harass as ""any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance that has the potential to o o injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild (Level A); or disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by disrupting behavioral patterns (for example, migration breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering) (Level B).""

Section 101(a)(5) (A-D) of the MMPA, as amended (16 U.S.c. 1371 (a)(5)), provides a mechanism for allowing, upon request, the ""incidental,"" but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographic region provided the takings would be (1) small in numbers, (2) have no more than a ""negligible impact"" on marine mammals, and (3) have no ""unmitigable adverse impact"" on subsistence harvests of these species. These ""incidental take"" authorizations, also known as Incidental Harassment Authorizations or Letters of Authorization, outline the following: o o o permissible methods and the specified geographical region of taking; means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species or stock and its habitat and on the availability of the species or stock for ""subsistence"" uses; and requirements for monitoring and reporting, including the independent peer review of proposed monitoring plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.

As a matter of policy, MMS coordinates with NMFS and FWS to ensure that offshore operators comply with the MMP A and to identify mitigation and monitoring requirements, and other best practices that reduce the potential for take, for permits or approvals for G&G activities. A descriptive summary of the MMP A compliance process may be found at the following MMS website: http://www.mms.gov/eppd/compliance/mmpalindex.htm.

Uses of Geological and Geophysical Survey Data
Geological and geophysical (G&G) surveys provide information used by industry and government to evaluate the potential for offshore oil, gas, and methane hydrate resources and geologic hazards. The oil and gas industry needs accurate data on the location, extent, and properties of hydrocarbon resources, as well as information on shallow geologic hazards and seafloor geotechnical properties, in order to explore, develop, produce, and transport hydrocarbons safely and economically. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) also needs this information to fulfill its statutory responsibilities to ensure safe operations, support environmental impact analyses, protect benthic and archaeological resources through avoidance measures, ensure fair market value for leases, make royalty relief determinations, conserve oil and gas resources, and perform other statutory responsibilities. The MMS regulatory staff specifically uses G&G data to ensure that the proposed site of bottomfounded structures is safe (i.e., via geohazards review) and that the foundations are properly designed (i.e. , based on engineering parameters determined from cores), thus ensuring safe operations. The MMS environmental staff uses these G&G data in complying with various environmental laws, such as the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and to support mitigation measures and decisions to protect benthic, historic archaeological, and other natural resources. The MMS resource evaluation staffusesdeep twodimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) seismic data for resources estimation and bid evaluation to ensure that the Government receives a fair market value for tracts offered. The MMS production and development staff uses 2D, 3D and four-dimensional seismic data to map reserves and to develop evaluations for conservation of resources. For additional information, refer to Section I.B. of Geological and Geophysical Exploration for Mineral Resources on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf-Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (OCS EISIEA MMS 2004-054), which can be found at http://www.gornr.mms.gov/PDFs/200412004-054.pdf.

Atlantic Geological and Geophysical Survey Regulatory Authority
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is responsible for overseeing all activities associated with mineral resource development on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), including assessment, leasing, exploration, development, production, and royalty management. Geological and geophysical (G&G) activities aimed at mineral exploration are subject to a complex series of permits and notices. The MMS Resource Evaluation Program oversees G&G data acquisition and permitting activities, pursuant to regulations at 30 CFR 250, 251, and 281. Specifically, these regulations include (1) Part 251 - regulating prelease G&G exploratory operations for oil, gas, and sulfur resources; and (2) Part 280 - regulating prelease prospecting activities. Postlease G&G activities are governed by regulations at 30 CFR 250 and by applicable Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTL's). Other regulations also pertain to one or more of the issues considered in this analysis (e.g., the President's Council on Environmental Quality, guidelines for implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act, and pertinent regulations administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service). The purpose of the MMS regulatory program is to ensure that the G&G data needed by industry and government are obtained in a technically safe and environmentally sound manner. The MMS regulations at 30 CFR 251 mandate that G&G activities may not interfere with or endanger operations under any lease. Operations overseen and permitted by MMS must comply with various environmental laws (e.g., Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act). For additional information on the regulatory framework for G&G activity, refer to Section I.C. and Section I of Appendix B in Geological and Geophysical Exploration for Mineral Resources on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf-Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (OCS EIS/EA MMS 2004-054), which can be found at the following MMS website:

Atlantic oes Geological and Geophysical Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is preparing a programmatic environmental impact statement (PElS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) to evaluate the potential environmental effects of multiple geological and . geophysical (G&G) exploration activities on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The NEP A is the foundation of environmental policymaking in the United States. The NEP A process is intended to incorporate the best available information and stakeholder input to help public officials make decisions based on an understanding of environmental consequences and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment for actions they authorize. The G&G surveys provide information used by the offshore energy industry and government to evaluate the potential for offshore oil, gas, and methane hydrate resources and geologic hazards. Industry needs accurate data on the location, extent, and properties of hydrocarbon resources, as well as information on shallow geologic hazards and seafloor geotechnical properties, in order to explore, develop, produce, and transport hydrocarbons safely and economically. The MMS also needs this information to fulfill its statutory responsibilities to ensure that the G&G data needed by industry and government are obtained in a A technically safe and environmentally sound manner, pursuant to regulations in 30 CFR 250, 251, and 281. The proposed PElS will evaluate the environmental impacts of multiple G&G activities in OCS waters of the Atlantic. No NEPA programmatic documents have been performed for MMS-authorized G&G activities in the Atlantic OCS. The PElS is proposed for the Atlantic OCS in light of multiple permits received by MMS and industry'S expressed interest in expanding activities into the Atlantic offshore waters. This PElS will determine whether significant impacts to Atlantic resources could occur as a result of G&G activities and, where needed, will outline mitigation and monitoring measures that will reduce or eliminate the potential for impacts to the environment. The NEPA process will begin with a Notice of Intent (NO I) to prepare a PElS published in the

Federal Register. Included in the NOI is a call for interest for future industry G&G activity on the Atlantic OCS. Information collected from the G&G industry will be used to develop the action area and activity level to be evaluated under this PElS and may include the entire Atlantic OCS or only portions of it. Through the NEPA process, MMS will also hold public scoping meetings on the PElS to solicit comments from stakeholders on the scope of the PElS, identify significant issues to be analyzed in the PElS, and identify possible alternatives to a proposed action. More information on the dates and locations of the scoping meetings will be published in the Federal Register in the near future.

In addition to NEPA, G&G activities must also comply with several other environmental statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, MagnusonStevens Fishery and Conservation Management Act, and Coastal Zone Management Act. These statutes all require further coordination and consultation, and in some cases authorization, with several agencies on specific environmental issues (e.g., effects to threatened and endangered species, marine mammals, essential fish habitat, benthic resources, and coastal zones).

Descriptions of Geological and Geophysical Activities
Regulatory authority for geological and geophysical (G&G) surveys are authorized by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCS Lands Act); (Title 43, Chapter 29, Subchapter III, ? 1340); 30 CFR 250 Subpart B (onlease); 30 CFR 251 (exploration); and 30 CFR 280 (minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur). The following are descriptions of potential G&G activities associated with oil and gas, as well as non-mineral resources (sand and gravel), and alternative energy activities. These activities include the various G&G exploration techniques currently being used in other areas and expected to be employed in the future by operators in the Atlantic OCS. Particular attention is paid to seismic techniques, especially the role of seismic sources (e .g., airguns). Seismic surveys have historically covered large areas of the OCS each year and have the potential for ""significant"" impacts on the environment, unless mitigation and monitoring measures to reduce or eliminate impacts to the environment are applied. Further, there are increasing concerns in the regulatory and scientific communities regarding acoustic impacts on marine life, including marine mammals, turtles, and fishes. Therefore, seismic surveys are described first, followed by the other techniques. Hie:h-Resolution Seismic Data. High-resolution site surveys collect data using electrically generated acoustic sources from 140 to 210 decibels (dB) that are reflected from sediments near the seafloor surface to several kilometers or more below the seafloor. They are used for various reasons - to investigate potential geohazards and soil conditions, to identify potential benthic biological communities (or habitats) and archaeological resources, or to a lesser degree for exploration purposes. Such high-resolution data may be used for initial site evaluation for drilling rig emplacement and for platform or pipeline design and emplacement. They can also be used for the identification of potential sand resources for coastal restoration. High-resolution site survey data obtained at greater depths below the seafloor can be used for exploration purposes. Deep-Penetration Seismic Surveys. Deep-penetration seismic exploration and development surveys are conducted to obtain data on geological formations from the sediment near-surface to several thousand meters deep (below the sediment surface). A survey vessel will tow a lowfrequency acoustic source (usually high-pressure airgun arrays) that penetrates several thousand feet in the earth's subsurface and are then refracted to surface receivers, either towed in the water column or placed on the ocean bottom. These acoustic sources are generated by airguns, generating compressed air bubbles, and are generally in the 225- to 260-dB range for airgun arrays. This information enables industry to accurately assess potential hydrocarbon reservoirs and helps to optimally locate exploration and development wells, maximizing extraction and production from a reservoir. In two-dimensional or three-dimensional seismic surveys, the receivers (hydrophones) are on streamer cables towed behind the survey vessel at a depth of 5 to

10 meters (m) below the surface of the water. Individual streamers can be up to 12 kilometers (km) in length or, on rare occasions, even longer. Tail buoys with radar reflectors and strobe lights are used to mark the end of the streamers and make them more visible and/or detectable to other vessels. Alternatively, receivers may be deployed on the seafloor as bottom cable surveys or remotely-operated vehicle positioned ""nodes."" When conventional 3D ship surveys or bottom cable surveys are repeated at the same location over time, these are referred to as 4D or timelapse surveys. Another method of determining downhole seismic through the wellbore involves vertical cables with receivers suspended within wellbores and an external source used in the water column, usually by another vessel or a source hung over the rig.
Deep-Tow, Sidescan-Sonar Surveys. Deep-tow, sidescan-sonar surveys are conducted in the Gulf of Mexico primarily for engineering studies involving the placement of production facilities and pipelines. These surveys provide information on the presence of sand flows, hydrates, and seeps, as well as bottom topography (e.g., hard bottom).

Operations are conducted from ships towing cables up to 7 km long, which enables operations in water depths up to 3,000 m deep. Close to the end of the cable is a 30- to 45-m long section of chain to keep the sensor package (fish) tracking at approximately 25-30 m above the bottom. To do this requires the chain to be dragged along the seafloor, causing an approximately 10 centimeter (cm) wide by 15 cm deep (4 inch wide by 6 inch deep) trench to be cut in the seafloor. In situations where the chain can become entangled in shipwrecks, well heads, or other obstructions or where reef colonies live, the chain is removed, and the sensor package is kept above the seafloor by adjusting the length of the tow cable. Maintaining a constant elevation above the seafloor by adjusting the cable length is very difficult, and the elevation above the seafloor is somewhat greater in this case.
Electromagnetic Surveys. Electromagnetic surveys are used to help delineate potential oil and gas reservoirs. Many geological processes in the crust and upper mantle of the seafloor involve the interaction of fluid phases with surrounding rock. The conductivities of hydrothermal phases are different from those of host rock, and collectively they offer distinct profiles of electrical conductivity/resistivity depending on the specific geological process involved. Magnetotelluric surveys are passive measurement of the earth's electromagnetic fields. Additionally, controlled source electromagnetic surveys, sometimes referred to as seabed logging, induce very lowfrequency (typically less than 2 hertz) electromagnetic signals into the upper layers of the seafloor via a towed dipole. The signals are propagated laterally to an array of receivers kilometers away. The variations in the electromagnetic field relative to the geometry of the receiver arrays and distance provide a conductivity/resistivity profile of the seafloor. From the profile, hydrocarbon reservoirs can be differentiated from water reservoirs and surrounding rock. Geological and Geochemical Sampling. Geological and geochemical sampling is conducted to obtain samples of the seafloor for physical and/or chemical analyses. Physical analyses are used in engineering studies for the placement of structures such as platforms and pipelines. Chemical analyses (surface geochemical prospecting) are based on the premise that upward migrated petroleum from deep source rocks and reservoirs can be detected in near-surface sediments and are used to evaluate exploration potential.

Bottom sampling involves devices that penetrate only a few centimeters to several meters below the seafloor. Samples of near surface sediments are typically obtained by dropping a piston core or gravity core (""dart""), essentially a weighted tube, to the ocean floor and recovering it with an attached wire line. Samples can also be obtained using a grab, which is a device with a jaw-like mechanism, or with a dredge, which is a wire cage dragged along the seafloor. Shallow coring is done by conventional rotary drilling equipment from a drilling barge or boat. Penetration is usually limited to the recovery of several feet of consolidated rock. Usually, a program of bottom sampling and shallow coring is conducted simultaneously using a small marine drilling vessel. Surface geochemical prospecting is a petroleum exploration technique based on the premise that upward migrated petroleum from deep source rocks and reservoirs can be detected in nearsurface sediments and used to evaluate exploration potential. In deepwater exploration, a crucial and arguably the most critical single issue is whether oil has been generated and, if it has, what can be determined, before making costly decisions, regarding the quality, maturity, and age of the source succession. Fortunately, since oil and gas accumulations are invariably leaky, surface geochemical exploration can be used to recover and type migrant hydrocarbons in the initial exploration phases.

Remote Sensing. Radar imaging is currently used to detect oil slicks on the sea surface. This is possible because, when the oil molecules reach the sea surface, they form a thin layer that dampens the ocean surface capillary waves. The detection of oil slicks requires quiet water conditions and consequently is limited by sea state as well as by satellite position and frequency of coverage. Aeromagnetic Surveys. Aeromagnetic surveys are conducted in the Gulf of Mexico to look for
deep crustal structure, salt-related structure, and intrasedimentary anomalies. The surveys are flown by twin-engine, fixed-wing aircraft, typically Cessna 404 or 208, Piper Aerostar, or Navajos. The flight lines are on the order of 400 km long, are at a height of75-150 m above the surface, and are flown at speeds of about 220 kmlhour.

Gravity Surveys. Marine gravity data can be collected with instruments on the seafloor, in boreholes, in ships, or in helicopters. Data were originally collected on the seafloor, but modem technology has moved the collection point to ships. Marine gravity meters have, in some cases, been housed in a ship while it is conducting aseismic survey. However, the preferred method has been to use dedicated ships (about 50 m long) in order to acquire more precise data. With the advent of global positioning systems navigation systems and larger, more stable seismic ships, it is now possible to achieve the same order of accuracy with meters placed in seismic ships as in dedicated ships. Data grids for gravity surveys range from 1.6 km by 8 km to 9.7 km by 32 km. Marine Magnetic Surveys. Marine magnetic surveys measure the earth's magnetic field for the
purpose of determining structure and sedimentary properties of subsurface horizons. These surveys are usually conducted in conjunction with a seismic survey, allowing the navigation information to be used for both surveys. The development of low-power digital sensors has allowed the sensor package to be towed behind the seismic source array, which has greatly improved the operational efficiency of magnetic surveys.

Melissa - I had my comment period information mixed up with the draft proposed program for the 5-year OCS leasing program - for which comment period has been extended to Sept 2009. The Cape Wind Project FElS was published on Jan 21, and MMS continued to take comments via the online commenting system until March 20, 2009. MMS is focused on ensuring that all environmental reviews use the most current scientific information. We are reviewing the NEP A documents associated with the Cape Wind Project and when that review, along with the CAA Conformity and the NHP A consultation are completed, the Record of Decision will be issued.

Subject:
Wendy, this email is following up on the outstanding items you had requested. Previously we sent you information on OCS sales, leasing and drilling activity. You had also requested information on the number of OCS sales and plans for exploration, development and production that were denied ClM consistency by a state. The MMS database does not track information on ClM decisions. NOAA is the agency of record for ClM appeals. The OCS projects that have had consistency denied and been appealed to NOAA are included in the attached document. List 2 in the attachment consolidates all OCS projects. ClM decisions that have been appealed date from the mid 1980's through the 1990's. Since that time, there have been projects that have been neither denied nor approved but held in suspension while additional information is requested. Unlike NEPA, CZMA does not provide for upholding decisions based on incomplete information. Presumably, NOAA will have more information relating to this although it seems that many of these cases remain between companies and states. NOAA mainly becomes involved when a state denies consistency and then the company can appeal the decision. If no decision is ever rendered, the project is left in a rather difficult state. Additional information on CZMA program can be found at:

http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/consistency/welcome.htm1
Also, the attached summary of OCS Sale litigation was prepared in response to your request. Finally, our folks are pulling together the data on the number of exploration and development plans filed by OCS regions from 1998 to date. I have asked for an ETA and will get back with you as soon as possible.

I think this information would be most useful to us if it was organized by location (at least by region, but ideally by location), by year: 1. the number of tracts offered 2. the acres offered 3. number of tracts bid on 4. number of acres bid on 5. number of tracts leased 6.

A summary by year (not needed by location unless it's easy to break out that way) how many drilling permits were issued, and how many were challenged. I think #1-6 is already on MMS' website, so I'm guessing the real data work is compiling with that list the requests in #7-10. Because the number of lease sales isn't overwhelming, and the number of regions fairly restricted , my hope is that the total aggregation will be manageable.

Subject: OCS sand Jon, I thought I would follow up our telephone call from the other week should you have any additional questions. To summarize your inquiry: Your question was in regards to a study being conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers called the ""Mississippi Coastal Improvement Program"". This program is being funded by Congress to look at the barrier islands along the MS coast. Your/Representative Bonner's concern is the need to preserve OCS sand off of the coast of Alabama for the State's possible need/use in the future, one element being that the sands match Alabama's beaches. You asked about the possibility that these sands may be diverted to use for the MS barrier island initiative. You also asked about the process for obtaining sand to which I directed you to our website. Were you able to find the information you were looking for? Specific pages: http ://www .mms. gov/sandandgravel/ http://www.mms.gov/sandandgravel/ObtainingMarineMinerals.htm I also suggested that Alabama's members on the Outer Continental Shelf Policy Committee would be a good resource for you, as they have participated in the OCSPC Subcommittee on Hard Minerals. You were already aware of Mr. Tew. Specific contact information if you need it: Member: Berry H. Tew, Jr. State Geologist and Oil and Gas Supervisor Geological Survey of Alabama P.O.

APR - 2 2009
The Honorable Lisa Murkowski United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Senator Murkowski: Thank you for your fax dated January 20,2009, to Ms. Lyn Herdt, on behalf of your constituents Ms. Jeanne Porter and Mr. Gary Porter of Bald Mountain Air Services, Inc., in Homer, Alaska. As Acting Director for the Minerals Management Service (MMS), I have been asked to respond. Mr. and Ms. Porter raised concerns with MMS contracting with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce, for aircraft services in conjunction with environmental studies MMS is conducting offshore in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Previously, MMS had an Interagency Agreement (IA) with the Department ofthe Interior's National Business Center to obtain aircraft services for the bowhead whale and marine mammal survey program. MMS employees performed the scientific observations while on the aircraft. In 2006, MMS determined that it could no longer allocate MMS scientists to perform the scientific observations. Accordingly, MMS had to rethink the approach to continuing the monitoring program. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements with the Department of Commerce (in this case NOAA) to utilize its capabilities to the maximum extent practicable. Given NOAA's extensive experience performing such surveys, MMS chose to collaborate with and enter into an IA with the NOAA National Marine Mammal Laboratory. This decision promotes collaboration and efficiency, and MMS believes it is in the best interest of ""good government."" Under the lA, it is NOAA's responsibility to determine the most appropriate means for accomplishing the objectives, including aircraft services. I have enclosed a copy of my letter to Ms. Jeanne Porter in response to her letter addressed to Mr. Randall Luthi, which provides additional detail as to the authorities and rationale that govern this decision. I appreciate your continued interest and support for MMS's scientific research program in Alaska's OCS. If you need further information, please contact me at (202) 208-3500 or Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS Office of Congressional Affairs, at (202) 208-3502. Sincerely,

Walter D. Cruickshank Acting Director Enclosure

employees performed the scientific observations while on the aircraft. In 2006, the MMS determined that it could no longer allocate MMS scientists to continue to perform the scientific observations. As a consequence, the MMS had to completely rethink the approach to continue the monitoring program. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act specifically directs the Secretary ofInterjor (and therefore MMS) to enter into agreements with the Department of Commerce (in this case NOAA) to utilize its capabilities to the maximum extent practicable. o The MMS chose to collaborate with and enter into an IA with the NOAA National Marine Mammal Laboratory. This decision promotes collaboration and efficiency between two Federal agencies and, MMS believes, is in the best interest of good government. The decision to enter into an IA with NOAA was based on many reasons, including: 1. NOAA has the scientific expertise to perform the surveys and to meet MMS's science objectives; 2. NOAA has extensive experience performing such surveys; 3. NOAA has a statutory mandate to conduct this type of research and utilize the resulting science; and 4. NOAA science is highly regarded throughout the world. o Under the lA, it is NOAA's responsibility to determine the most appropriate means for accomplishing the science objectives, including what aircraft services are to be procured, if any.'

We hope you find this information useful in understanding our action, given MMS's needs and responsibilities in regards to our procurement of environmental studies. We are mindful of the directive regarding small-business set-asides, but this cannot be the sole criterion by which we procure our environmental studies. If! can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call me at (202) 208-3500, or call Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS, Office of Congressional Affairs at (202) 208-3502. Sincerely,

Subject: Request from Sen. Wicker's staff re: GOMESA
Hi Sarah, Anita asked that I respond to your email from Thursday. While our intent is to allocate revenues by March of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which qualifying revenues are received (a little ahead of the requirement), legally we are obligated to allocate by the end of the fiscal year (September). We are hoping to allocate FY09 revenues earlier than March 2010 if we can, but we cannot commit at this point. The FY 2008 allocation (paid March 2009) was based on the EGOM Sale bonus and first year rentals. The allocations also included small amounts from tracts sold in Sale 205 and Sale 206 that had a portion of their acreage lying east of the eastern planning area/central planning area administrative boundary. FY 2009 allocations (to be paid in 2010) would include rentals (and perhaps royalties if any of those become producing) from those leases and the bonus dollars and first year rentals from Sale 208 ""181 South"" leases. Not only will revenue totals will change each year as rentals are due as some properties switch over to royalty paying, some additional bonus in GOMESA areas will be received. The allocation to the states and subdivisions will change as well -- which is based on an inverse distance relationship between the states/subdivisions and all of the GOMESA areas under lease. So, the revenue totals and the allocation percentages will most likely also change (another factor ... increased areas leased in Sale 208). We cannot accurately predict future GOMESA revenues by state--- in addition to the factors above, GOMESA properties can be relinquished, operations suspended, and there is no way to predict which blocks will be leased in the future. Theoretically, since the FY07 -FY16 allocations are based only on revenues from the two relatively small geographic areas, the percents shared between the four states should not change dramatically. They should stay within +/- 3 percentage points of the FY08 allocation percents. But the amounts that are shared each year will obviously change. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Cheri

Subject: GOMESA Question
Anita,

I called the main number at MMS, explained the information I was looking for, and was directed to you. I apologize for this ""out of the blue"" email but appreciate any help you can provide.
I am trying to track down some information regarding the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. I am interested in the revenues estimated to go to the states of MS, LA, AL, and TX from FV8S to FV16. I have the percentage breakdown going to each of the states through FV16 (27% annually to MS, 30% to AL, 32% to LA, and 11% to TX). What I don't know is what this means in terms of dollars estimated to go to each state. I am not sure if those projections even exist but just wanted to check.

To summarize, what do those percentages equate to in terms of dollars (FV8S-FV16)? Again, thanks in advance for any information you may be able to send my way. Sarah

Subject: Congressional Request - FW: PElS for Atlantic OCS Hi Nick, You requested some information on the Atlantic seismic PElS. Please see the following. On January 21, 2009, the MMS published in the Federal Register a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Atlantic Geological and Geophysical (G&G) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), analyzing the potential for effects from the conduct of all types of G&G activities in the U.S. Atlantic OCS, mainly seismic surveys. The comment period closed on March 23, 2009, and the comments are currently being analyzed. In the NOI, the MMS acknowledged there is currently no existing funding for this EIS and welcomed participation from outside sources. To date: o Six geophysical companies have submitted ten permit applications to acquire seismic data on the Atlantic OCS. o The applications total over 270,000 line miles of 2-D data, covering all or part of the three Atlantic Planning Areas from Maine to Florida. o An additional three companies are expressing interest. o There is a concentration of overlapping surveys mostly, .in the mid and south Atlantic areas. o As stated in the NOI, MMS will need to prepare the Programmatic EIS to evaluate the environmental impacts of activities in this area prior to issuing these seismic permits. o The oil and gas industry has expressed some willingness to consider funding the EIS. o Until there is funding, the EIS cannot be started. If MMS needs to fund through a budget initiative, we would likely not know for a couple of years if this will ultimately pass. o We are currently exploring all of our options for funding this work, including the potential to reprioritize work to see if there is a possibility of making MMS funding available.

Subject: Congressional Request - FW: PElS for Atlantic OCS Hi Nick, Please see responses to your questions below. I guess the one big question I have is how the survey's and the gathering of seismic data relates to the ability (or industry interest) in leasing parts of the OCS. Specifically - does the lack of data make it harder for MMS to issue leases on the OCS or are these two issues not related? The inability to collect ""new"" seismic data would not necessarily prevent MMS from issuing leases. There currently exist extensive 2D seismic data over a substantial portion of all Atlantic Planning Areas that could be used and/or reprocessed by companies to base their levels of interest in specific areas. However this data was acquired more than 20 years ago when the technology was quite a bit different than today and most commercial interests feel that they can reduce their risks by having more up-to-date data sets. This would explain why several companies have filed requests for permits with MMS to acquire new seismic data over the entire Atlantic area. This old data would probably make it more difficult for industry to justify higher dollar amounts for the leasing rights. Also - do these survey's provide data that is unique and useful to those interested in offshore wind projects? Companies involved with renewable energy, such as wind and current projects, will need to acquire high resolution seismic data primarily to position offshore structures on stable subsea strata. This data would also be useful to fulfill their responsibilities needed to be in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Although this would produce a data set focused at a shallower depths (usually up to - several hundred feet) than the deeper focused exploration seismic (focused to -20,000-30,000 feet), it still introduces a substantial acoustic source into the ocean environment. Note that high resolution seismic is also required for identification of sand/gravel sources in Federal waters that is used in many coastal restoration projects. Some of our constituents are concerned that this is the first step in opening up the Atlantic OCS and the Gulf of Maine in particular to offshore oil activity. At this point, we are trying to assess the risk and the need for action ... See comments above Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Cheri

Hi Nick, Please see responses to your questions below. I guess the one big question I have is how the survey's and the gathering of seismic data relates to the ability (or industry interest) in leasing parts of the OCS. Specifically - does the lack of data make it harder for MMS to issue leases on the OCS or are these two issues not related? The inability to collect ""new"" seismic data would not necessarily prevent MMS from issuing leases. There currently exist extensive 20 seismic data over a substantial portion of all Atlantic Planning Areas that could be used and/or reprocessed by companies to base their levels of interest in specific areas. However this data was acquired more than 20 years ago when the technology was quite a bit different than today and most commercial interests feel that they can reduce their risks by having more up-to-date data sets. This would explain why several companies have filed requests for permits with MMS to acquire new seismic data over the entire Atlantic area. This old data would probably make it more difficult for industry to justify higher dollar amounts for the leasing rights. Also - do these survey's provide data that is unique and useful to those interested in offshore wind projects? Companies involved with renewable energy, such as wind and current projects, will need to acquire high resolution seismic data primarily to position offshore structures on stable subsea strata. This data would also be useful to fulfill their responsibilities needed to be in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Although this would produce a data set focused at a shallower depths (usually up to - several hundred feet) than the deeper focused exploration seismic (focused to -20,000-30,000 feet), it still introduces a substantial acoustic source into the ocean environment. Note that high resolution seismic is also required for identification of sand/gravel sources in Federal waters that is used in many coastal restoration projects. Some of our constituents are concerned that this is the first step in opening up the Atlantic OCS and the Gulf of Maine in particular to offshore oil activity. At this point, we are trying to assess the risk and the need for action ... See comments above Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Cheri

Hi Nick, You requested some information on the Atlantic seismic PElS. Please see the following. On January 21, 2009, the MMS published in the Federal Register a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Atlantic Geological and Geophysical (G&G) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). analyzing the potential for effects from the conduct of all types of G&G activities in the U.S. Atlantic DeS, mainly seismic surveys. The comment period closed on March 23, 2009, and the comments are currently being analyzed. In the NOI, the MMS acknowledged there is currently no existing funding for this EIS and welcomed participation from outside sources. To date: o Six geophysical companies have submitted ten permit applications to acquire seismic data on the Atlantic DeS. o The applications total over 270,000 line miles of 2?0 data, covering all or part of the three Atlantic Planning Areas from Maine to Florida. o An additional three companies are expressing interest. o There is a concentration of overlapping surveys mostly, in the mid and south Atlantic areas. o As stated in the NOI, MMS will need to prepare the Programmatic EIS to evaluate the environmental impacts of activities in this area prior to issuing these seismic permits. o The oil and gas industry has expressed some willingness to consider funding the EIS. o Until there is funding, the EIS cannot be started. If MMS needs to fund through a budget initiative, we would likely not know for a couple of years if this will ultimately pass. o We are currently exploring all of our options for funding this work, including the potential to reprioritize work to see if there is a possibility of making MMS funding available.

The Associated Press
(04/17/0909:01:12) WASHINGTON - A program to expand oil and gas drilling off the Alaska coast was canceled Friday by a federal appeals court that ruled the Bush administration did not properly study the environmental impact.

A three-judge panel in Washington found that the Bush-era Interior Department failed to consider the effect on the environment and marine life before it began the process in August 2005 to expand an oil and gas leasing program in the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi seas. The appeals court ordered the department, now run by President Barack Obama's appointee Ken Salazar, to analyze the areas to determine environmental risks and potential damage before moving ahead with the program. The seas are home to wildlife including polar bears, whales, seals, walruses and seabirds. The lawsuit was brought by three environmental groups that want to protect the ecosystem and the Native Village of Point Hope, Alaska, a tribe that lives off the wildlife on the Chukchi Sea coast. The decision comes at a time when oil and gas producers are finding it increasingly difficult to find new reserves and boost production, at home and abroad. Output from the biggest U.S. oil companies has largely been in decline in the past few years. Even though most people recognize the names of the giant multinationals - Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP and others - they control less than 10 percent of the world's oil reserves. Most proven reserves about 80 percent - are held by national, state-run companies like those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. The Interior Department was reviewing the decision Friday and did not immediately comment. The department had already delayed the leasing program by five years to complete environmental studies. Attorney William Snape, who argued the case for the environmentalists before the appeals court, said the species in the area are already under significant environmental threat because of global warming. He said Interior Secretary Salazar has sent mixed signals on how he'll handle drilling in the outer continental shelf, but the ruling is a chance for the new administration to protect the sensitive areas. ""We're seeing a whole ecosystem potentially collapse,"" Snape said. ""This really is a great opportunity for Salazar to do the right thing."" So far, the Interior Department has only approved one lease sale in the disputed areas, which involved more than 29 million acres in the Chukchi Sea, extending from about 50 miles to 200 miles offshore. The sale in February 2008 attracted 667 bids totaling almost $3.4 billion, the most in any offshore lease sale in Alaska history. The high bids totaled more than $2.6 million. Associated Press Energy Writer John Porretto in Houston contributed to this report.

I write to you regarding clarification of project funding for state and local project priorities in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA).

While meeting with a number of constituents during the April recess regarding potential projects that could be considered for GOMESA funding, one question seemed to repeat itself, and I was not able to provide an answer. Could you please elaborate on the rules and regulations for GOMESA funding for repayment of debt service on approved projects? Before bonds can be issued, some authorizers want assurances that if their projects are approved by either state or county to be GOMES A compliant and once funding is received it can be used for debt relief of that particular project. Any clarification you can offer would be greatly appreciated. If you are in need of additional infonnation, please contact Mrs. Brooks Chew or Mr, Jon Hand of my staff at any time. With kindest regards, I am

!JllR://www.mms.gov/offshore/GOMESARevenueSharing.htm

Jon, The FY 08 allocations can be found on the link above. Regarding your question on future allocations, the following information was provided for a similar request last week. Please let me know if you have additional questions. Cheri
Cheri Hunter Office of Congressional Affairs Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Minerals Management Service Department of the Interior Cheri. hunter@mms.gov (202) 208-3788

Question : I am interested in the revenues estimated to go to the states of MS, LA, AL, and TX from FY08 to FY16. Answer: While our intent is to allocate revenues by March of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which qualifying revenues are received (a little ahead of the requirement), legally we are obligated to allocate by the end of the fiscal year (September). We are hoping to allocate FY09 revenues earlier than March 2010 if we can, but we cannot commit at this point. The FY 2008 allocation (paid March 2009) was based on the EGOM Sale bonus and first year rentals. The allocations also included small amounts from tracts sold in Sale 205 and Sale 206 that had a portion of their acreage lying east of the eastern planning area/central planning area administrative boundary. FY 2009 allocations (to be paid in 2010) would include rentals (and perhaps royalties if any of those become producing) from those leases and the bonus dollars and first year rentals from Sale 208 ""181 South"" leases. Not only will revenue totals will change each year as rentals are due as some properties switch over to royalty paying, some additional bonus in GOMESA areas will be received. The allocation to the states and subdivisions will change as well -- which is based on an inverse distance relationship between the states/subdivisions and all of the GOMESA areas under lease. So, the revenue totals and the allocation percentages will most likely also change (another factor ... increased areas leased in Sale 208) . We cannot accurately predict future GOMESA revenues by state--- in addition to the factors above, GOMESA properties can be relinquished, operations suspended, and there is no way to predict which blocks will be leased in the future . Theoretically, since the FY07-FY16 allocations are based only on revenues from the two relatively small geographic areas, the percents shared between the foW states should not change dramatically. They should stay within +/- 3 percentage points of the FY08 allocation percents. But the amounts that are shared each year will obviously change.

Subject: FW: leases issued in current 5-Year with production Tim, A correction to the number of leases producing from the current 5-year plan. There are four. You asked for the locations, they are noted in red below. Still working on royalties and rents, I'm told that will come early next week. Thanks, have a great weekend. Cheri There are 3 leases in TIMS that are in a producing status and have current OGOR production: G31304 (West Cameron West 366) ,G31435 (Main Pass 107) , and G31470 (Ewing Bank 782) (shallow water Central Gulf of Mexico leases in water depths of 400 meters or less) There is one other lease that has a First Prod Date in Well Completions and a Lease on Prod Date in Lease Operations Status but no OGOR production because of a 6 month production lag time: G31040 (High Island 138 -- shallow water Western Gulf of Mexico)

From: Hunter, Cheri Sent: Monday, April 20, 2009 B:13 PM To: tim.charters@mail.house.gov Cc: ?Herdt, Lyn; Gonzales-Evans, Anita Subject: 2007-2012 OCS Plan Tim, Chris's testimony provided for the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources hearing on March 17 contained the following statement: Since the current 5-Year Program began on July 1, 2007, 6 sales have been held resulting in 2,395 new leases and $10 billion in bonus bids. We are looking up the associated rentals. On March 1B, Sale 20B (Central GOM) was held. Bid evaluation is ongoing, as of today no leases have yet to be issued. The link to the Stats for Sale 20B is http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/lsesale/20B/stat20B.odf.Asyouknow.itis not guaranteed that all high bids will be accepted and a lessee may choose to not execute a lease even if we accept (in that rare case -- but if it does happen, the Government keeps the 1/5th bonus bid). IF all high bids on all leases were accepted and the leases were executed, the first year rentals would amount to $lB,944,247. FYI, two points: Potential lessees have 11 business days to execute the lease which includes paying the balance of the bonus (the 4/5 balance is due with lease execution along with the first year rental). For bids that we reject, we return the 115th bonus received at the time of the sale. Rejected bids are returned with inter.est if a rejection decision is made. We are checking to see if any leases from the current 5-year program are in production.

Subject: OCS questions from Sen. Murkowski's staff per Patty Beneke

Hi Allison, thank you so much for forwarding this information to Patty. Patty, The following data on AK OCS Revenues was extracted from the MRM website. We only have Regional data broken out from 2001 on, I hope this is sufficient. Regarding your questions related to the establishment of a permit coordination office for AK OCS permits, I assume this would include all agencies involved with permit approval (MMS, FWS, NMFS, EPA, COE, USCG, the State(?)). There are many issues involved, from the conceptual (just one coordinating liaison from each agency? An office with full permitting authority (would require much larger staff)?) to the complexity of varying guiding laws and rulesitimelines. I'll discuss with Lyn when she returns on Monday and we will get back to you. Thanks, Cheri

Could you get information for Kevin Simpson (Senator Murkowski's staff) and me on how much rental income is on the OCS each year, and how much is generated in the Alaska OCS annually? Also, we are looking at the possibility of setting up a permit coordination office for Alaska OCS permits. What is a good estimate of how much funding would be necessary to do that? I was wondering if $2 million per year would be adequate to help move the permits forward on a timely basis. What do your folks think? Thanks, Patty

MAY 0 4 2009

The Honorable Doc Hastings House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515

Thank you for your letter dated March 5, 2009, cosigned by your colleagues, supporting the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Lease Sale 208 in the Central Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. On March 18, 2009, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) held Sale 208, as scheduled. I was honored to participate in Sale 208 and publicly announced the bidding results. The MMS received 476 bids on 348 tracts, offering $703 million in high bids, demonstrating the continued interest industry has in the Central Gulf of Mexico. Evaluation of the high bids to ensure fair market value has already begun. I recently met with the American public on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, as well as in Alaska, to get input that will help ensure that we develop the right kind of energy in the right places on the OCS. The security of our energy supply and stability of energy prices remain significant concerns for the Nation. Even as the Department of the Interior aggressively pursues renewable energy opportunities, domestic production of oil and gas is crucial, including oil and natural gas from the OCS. The need to continue to produce our traditional domestic energy resources and develop renewable energy resources, while remaining responsible stewards of our environment has never been greater. Again, thank you for sharing your concerns with me.

The OCSLA, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(1)), and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.10 provide for the suspension or temporary prohibition of an operation or activity when the suspension is in the national interest and when the suspension is necessary based on any of the conditions given at 30 CFR 250.1 O(a) through (c).

Cancellation of Leases
The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2)) and regulations at 30 CFR 250.12 authorize the Secretary to cancel a lease or permit if, after opportunity and notice for ahearing, he determines (1) continued activity would probably cause serious harm or damage to life, property, the environment, or security or defense; (2) the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable time; (3) the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continued activity; and (4) the suspension has been in effect for at least 5 years or the termination of suspension and lease cancellation are at the request of the lessee.

Remedies and Penalties
Under 43 U.S.C. 1350(b) of the OCSLA, as amended, and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.200-250.206, civil penalties can be assessed for failure to comply with responsibilities under the law, a license, a permit, or any regulation or order issued pursuant to the Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 changed the way MMS will address civil penalties and remedies. Civil penalties are now issued for serious violations. If the violation is serious enough and is found to be a knowing and willful violation, MMS may recommend that the matter be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution (43 U.S.C. 1350(c)). The issuance and continuance in effect of any lease or of any assignment or other transfer of any lease shall be conditioned upon compliance with regulations issued under the OCSLA.

362949-mms8-pdf-24-57-57,"Independence Project
The Independence Project, located in the ultra-deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, is a $2 billion development designed to bring previously stranded natural gas reserves to energy consumers in the United States. Through the collaborative efforts of Enterprise Products Partners, Helix Energy Solutions and four independent exploration & production companies, approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day (""Scfld"") of natural gas production and transportation capacity began producing in October 2007. The natural gas produced from this project was estimated to increase the supply of natural gas in the U.S. by approximately 2% and natural gas deliveries from the Gulf of Mexico by approximately 10%. The Independence Project consists of three main components: Independence Subsea, Independence Hub and Independence Trail. The Independence Hub facility, which is 80 percent-owned by affiliates of Enterprise, and 20 percent-owned by Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc., is a state of the art 1OS-foot deep-draft, semisubmersible platform. Enterprise, a leader in the development of midstream infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, designed, constructed and installed the Independence Hub platform. The facility is located in Mississippi Canyon block 920 in a water depth of approximately 8,000 feet. The platform is designed to process up to 1 Bcfld of natural gas production from the initial 10 anchor fields, with excess payload capacity to tie-back up to nine additional subsea flowlines. Independence Hub has the longest mooring lines in the world at 2.4 miles to moor the floating platform to the seafloor. The Independence Trail Naturai Gas Pipeline, which is 100 percent-owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise, is a new 134-mile, 24-inch pipeline that has the capacity to transport up to 1 Scfld of natural gas from the Independence Hub to an interconnect with Tennessee Gas Pipeline at West Delta block 68, a new platform also owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise. Independence Subsea consists of all the producer owned and operated facilities from the wells to tiebacks on the Independence Hub. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation, Dominion Exploration & Production and StatoilHydro own and operate the Independence Subsea facilities and production. The initial development of Independence Subsea includes 16 gas completions in 10 fields that are tied back subsea to the Independence Hub platform. The initial 10 anchor fields are located in the Atwater Valley (AT), Desoto Canyon (DC), Lloyd Ridge (LL), and Mississippi Canyon (MC) areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The longest subsea tie-back at Independence Hub is approximately 43 miles, but gas well subsea tiebacks can extend up to 60 to 75 miles from the host facility. The total miles of subsea flowlines associated with Independence Subsea is estimated at 210 miles. For more detailed information on the Independence Project see the Enterprise Product Partners website at www.epplp.com/projects/indProj.htm

Lynnel, good morning. When you have a minute to review this information please give me a call at 208-3828. Attached is the proposed itinerary and some background information on the Independence Project and the MMS inspection program, for the upcoming trip to the Gulf. Due to the need for the party to be at the New Orleans airport by 3:00 pm on Tuesday, we have moved the offshore tour to Monday morning and the briefing sessions on Tuesday. This will allow the full itinerary for the offshore trip, including a fly over of the LOOP on the return flight, MMS has asked for approval to fly over the LOOP facility. If there is inclement weather on Monday, the schedule will flip and the briefings will be held Monday and the offshore trip Tuesday. If the offshore trip does move to Tuesday, the itinerary will need to be shortened in order for the party to get to the airport by 3:00pm. This will most likely result in elimination of the fly over of the LOOP facility.
MMS requests a full list of the participants as soon as possible. In addition, BP management, operator of the Discoverer Enterprise drillship, requires a precautionary review of all offshore visitors relative to the issues with the H1 N1 Flu. And lastly, is Representative Scalise inviting any members of the media to participate in this trip? Look forward to speaking with you,

Planning Area Final Program Area

The oes Lands Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and maintain a schedule of proposed oes lease sales determined to ""best meet national ?energy needs for the 5-year period following its approval. .. "" The 5-year program specifies the size, timing and location of areas proposed for Federal offshore oil and gas leasing. The 5-Year Plan: o Responds to national energy needs while addressing economic, social and environmental concerns of the public; and o Reduces dependence on foreign oil and stimulates the domestic economy. Anticipated 40-year benefits from the 5-Year Plan approximately: o Additional 10 billion barrels of oil; o Additional 45 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; and o Additional $170 billion in net benefits to the Nation.
10

This initiative contains the following key components:
o Ensure Sale Operations ($2,300,000,' 0 FTE) - Deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico has increased significantly. There is currently a large inventory of deepwater leases waiting to be drilled. The MMS is expecting twelve to fifteen new deepwater rigs to arrive in the Gulf of Mexico by 2010 to address this need. This additional drilling activity will result in the need for additional MMS inspections in water further from shore Fair Public Return ($1,100,000,' 1 FTE) - The MMS requires funds to acquire the large amount of additional geological and geophysical data resulting from lease sales, staff and equipment to manage the analysis and physical protection of this data, and funds for the training of new resource evaluation staff. Environmental Studies ($1 ,600,000,' 2 FTE) - The MMS faces a critical need for environlnental information in the Chukchi Sea. Specifically, the need for information regarding the Polar Bear, Ribbon Seal, and Pacific Walrus will increase substantially as a result of concern regarding the status of these species.

? Natural barrier islands and wetlands, like those protecting coastal Louisiana's delta region, are rapidly deteriorating under the coupled stresses of temperature-driven sea level rise and increased storm frequency and intensity, along with direct human activity. In such areas where sand resources are extremely limited, rapid access is often necessary to provide immediate storm protection to coastal communities and nationally-important energy infrastructure. o The depletion of sand deposits in State waters, are continuing to elevate the demand for sand and gravel from the OCS. Based on current knowledge, MMS estimates that requests for OCS sand over the next five to ten years will be on the order of five to seven requests per year. The sand and gravel program benefits local communities where billions of dollars of infrastructure are at stake, and its protection is critical not only to the health of the environment but the econolnic health of those cOlnmunities who rely on a healthy coastal environment. MMS' s ability to provide these critical materials leads to strong positive relationships with coastal State governors, local communities, and their associated Congressional delegations, as well as other Federal agencies involved in the process.

This three-year initiative will (1) improve and streamline production reporting for Federal and Indian properties; (2) enhance the oil and gas production accountability and verification processes used to ensure that royalties are paid once production commences; and (3) provide data necessary for identifying and targeting gas plants and companies for audits and compliance reviews, such as changes to gas plant efficiency factors, which will be utilized in the compliance risk tool. The initiative incorporates proposals and recommendations from: GAO, the Royalty Policy Committee Report, and MRM's Strategic Business Planning initiative to improve the timeliness of available production data. Benefits of this initiative include increased timeliness and efficiency of providing production data, identifying missing production data, reducing Gas Verification System exception backlogs, monitoring gas plant efficiency exceptions, detecting nonpayment or underpayment of royalties once production commences, resolving production exceptions related to MMS and BLM well data discrepancies and overall improved coordination between MMS and the BLM.

This increase in compliance resources will add 21 FTE, 19 of which will provide audit expertise to implement the OIG's and Royalty Policy Committee Subcommittee's recommendations and the MMS Compliance Business Plan regarding use of a risk-based compliance strategy that will ensure that MRM increases properties and companies compliance coverage, while focusing on the highest risk. Additionally, 2 FTE will provide increased inquiry and outreach services to new Indian mineral owners. The increase in cOlnpliance resources will enable MRM to increase compliance collections, perform an estimated 33 additional audits annually, provide additional cOlnpliance coverage for Indian non-standard leases, and address increased workload related to high-risk noncompliant properties and companies. The increase will also enable MRM to annually respond to 300 additional inquiries from American Indians and provide 5 additional outreach sessions to Tribes.

Implement OIG Compliance and Audit Recommendations (-$1,156,000; -0 FTE): MRM requested funds in 2009 to develop and implement an automated risk-based compliance tool. Planned activities are fully funded in 2009 and further expenditure in this area other than ongoing operations costs is not needed in FY 2010. Improved Automated Interest Billing to Companies (-$1,360,000; -0 FTE): MRM requested funds in 2009 for systems enhancement as part of an effort to improve the timeliness and efficiency of the interest assessment to companies. Planned system enhancements and upgrades are fully funded in 2009 and further expenditures other than ongoing operations costs are not required in 2010. Interactive Payment Reconciliation and Billing (-$1,160,000; -0 FTE): MRM requested funds in 2008 for a two-year initiative to enhance MMS' s online reporting and verification system capabilities. Planned system enhancements and upgrades were fully funded in 2008 and 2009 and further expenditures other than ongoing operations costs are not required in 2010.

Offsetting Collections from Rents and Cost Recoveries (+$10.0 million; + 0 FTE): For FY 2010, MMS requests to retain $156,730,000 of eligible offsetting receipts to defray the costs of the Bureau's operations. This is a $10,000,000 increase over the FY 2009 enacted level. Inspection Fees (+$10.0 million; +0 FTE): The Department proposes to implement an inspection fee based on a tiered assessment for each above water oes oil and gas facility, except mobile offshore drilling units, that is subject to inspection by MMS. MMS is proposing that this be achieved by establishing a fee for inspection activities based upon the number of wells per facility. This provides for costs to be shared on a basis that is applied fairly and equally across the industry, and would support Federal efforts to provide services that not only ensure human safety, but also protect the environment and conserve energy and marine resources.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 Section 384, Coastal Impact Assistance Program, shares Federal Revenues of $250 mi1lion per year, for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 with six coastal producing states and their eligible coastal political subdivisions. No dollars are requested, but MMS is requesting authorizing language that would increase from three percent to four percent of the program funding to properly administer this largescale grants program. During the first two years of administering the ClAP program, MMS found the 3% funding adequate. In the beginning of fiscal year FY 2009, an analysis of projected ClAP-related obligations was performed, revealing an out-year funding shortage by the year 2014. The year 2014 is expected to be the final year with significant ClAP-related administrative obligations. To avoid this funding shortfall it is necessary to increase to 40/0 the amount of funds retained for administrative expenses in FY 20 I O. It should be noted that this is the final year any CrAP funding will be received and there will be a continued need in the out-years to continue program activity. The need for additional resources is due in large part to an increase in the scope of MMS involvement in reviewing state-wide plans and individual projects submitted by participating states. Costs of MMS personnel reviewing state plans and projects were initially estimated using the concept of reviewing each state plan and individual project once, thereby enabling the states and coastal sub-divisions to begin work. MMS is now receiving multiple submissions and modifications from the states which significantly increases review time, as a state plan or project cannot be approved by MMS without sufficient review. MMS has also been required to provide greater grant preparation assistance than was revealed as being necessary in early scoping efforts. Given the increased workload associated with reviewing state plans and projects and grant preparation assistance, there is also potential for increased costs associated with project monitoring and auditing, once more state projects get underway.

Levy Tax on Certain Oil and Gas Production According to the Government Accountability Office, the return to the taxpayer from OCS production is among the lowest in the world, despite other factors that make the U.S. a comparatively good place to invest in oil and gas development. In the interest of advancing important policy objectives, such as providing a more level playing field among producers, raising the return to the taxpayer, and encouraging sustainable domestic oil and production, the Administration is developing a proposal to impose an excise tax on certain oil and gas produced offshore in the future. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to develop this proposal's details and enact it into law. Ensure,' Respomtible Production \ Energy on Federal Lands DOl will take steps to ensure that oil and gas companies diligently develop their oil and gas leases or risk losing them (""use or lose""). One step is to charge a new fee on non-producing leases in the Gulf of Mexico. This provides an added incentive for oil companies to either start producing or relinquish the leases so that others may bid on them.

Inspections & Compliance
Inspection Program
The MMS inspection program in the Gulf of Mexico is directed by the Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana, and five district offices that provide day-to-day review and inspection of oil and gas operations. There are 55 inspectors that go offshore every day, weather permitting. During 2008, the Gulf of Mexico Region conducted 665 drilling inspections, 3,445 production inspections, 342 workover and completion inspections, 6,722 meters inspected, and 4,465 pipeline inspections. The MMS also inspects the stockpiles of industry's equipment for the containment and cleanup of oil spills. Stockpiles are located at nine strategic sites along the Gulf Coast. The MMS also has a program to conduct unannounced drills to test spill response preparedness of operators in the Gulf of Mexico. The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1348(c)) requires MMS to conduct onsite inspections to assure compliance with lease terms, NTL's, and approved plans, and to assure that safety and pollution-prevention requirements of regulations are met. These inspections involve items of safety and environmental concern. Further information on the baseline for the inspection of lessee operations and facilities can be found in the National Potential Incident of Noncompliance (PINC) List (USDOI, MMS, 1990a). Noncompliance with checklisted requirements for specific installations or procedures is followed by prescribed enforcement actions consisting of written warnings or shutins of platforms, zones (wells), equipment, or pipelines. In the event a noncompliance is detected, the inspector takes the appropriate enforcement action as dictated by the National PINC List. If an operator is found in violation of a safety or environmental requirement, a citation is issued requiring that it be fixed within 7 days. The violation may call for the particular well component, production component, or the entire complex to be shut in. The primary objective of initial inspections is to assure proper installation of mobile units or structures and associated equipment. After operations begin, additional announced and unannounced inspections are conducted. Surprise unannounced inspections are conducted to foster a climate of safe operations, to maintain an MMS presence, and to focus on operators with a poor performance record. They are also conducted after a critical safety feature has previously been found defective. Depending on the distance from shore and other factors such as weather and proximity to other inspections, each MMS district inspector will inspect from one to three different drilling rigs or platforms per day. Aerial surveillance of additional offshore structures is conducted enroute. Annual inspections are conducted on all platforms, but more frequent inspections may be conducted on rigs and platforms. On-board inspections involve the inspection of all safety systems of a production platform. In the interest of efficient and effective utilization of inspection resources, random sampling techniques are being evaluated for the selection of specific items for inspection from the national PINC list and a production platform's component list.

Subject To Change

Suspension of Operations
The OCSLA, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(1 )), and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.10 provide for the suspension or temporary prohibition of an operation or activity when the suspension is in the national interest and when the suspension is necessary based on any of the conditions given at 30 CFR 250.1 O(a) through (c).

Cancellation of Leases
The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2)) and regulations at 30 CFR 250.12 authorize the Secretary to cancel a lease or permit if, after opportunity and notice for a hearing, he determines (1) continued activity would probably cause serious harm or damage to life, property, the environment, or national security or defense; (2) the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable time; (3) the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continued activity; and (4) the suspension has been in effect for at least 5 years or the termination of suspension and lease cancellation are at the request of the lessee.

Remedies and Penalties
Under 43 U.S.C. 1350(b) of the OCSLA, as amended, and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.200-250.206, civil penalties can be assessed for failure to comply with responsibilities under the law, a license, a permit, or any regulation or order issued pursuant to the Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 changed the way MMS will address civil penalties and remedies. Civil penalties are now issued for serious violations. If the violation is serious enough and is found to be a knowing and willful violation, MMS may recommend that the matter be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution (43 U.S.C. 1350(c)). The issuance and continuance in effect of any lease or of any assignment or other transfer of any lease shall be conditioned upon compliance with regulations issued under the OCSLA.

362940-mms8-pdf-15-22-22,"Subject To Change Independence Project
The Independence Project, located in the ultra-deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, is a $2 billion development designed to bring previously stranded natural gas reserves to energy consumers in the United States. Through the collaborative efforts of Enterprise Products Partners, Helix Energy Solutions and four independent exploration & production companies, approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day (""Scfld"") of natural gas production and transportation capacity began producing in October 2007. The natural gas produced from this project was estimated to increase the supply of natural gas in the U.S. by approximately 2% and natural gas deliveries from the Gulf of Mexico by approximately 10%. The Independence Project consists of three main components: Independence Subsea, Independence Hub and Independence Trail. The Independence Hub facility, which is 80 percent-owned by affiliates of Enterprise, and 20 percent-owned by Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc., is a state of the art 105-foot deep-draft, semisubmersible platform. Enterprise, a leader in the development of midstream infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, designed, constructed and installed the Independence Hub platform. The facility is located in Mississippi Canyon block 920 in a water depth of approximately 8,000 feet. The platform is designed to process up to 1 Scfld of natural gas production from the initial 10 anchor fields, with excess payload capacity to tie-back up to nine additional subsea flowlines. Independence Hub has the longest mooring lines in the world at 2.4 miles to moor the floating platform to the seafloor. The Independence Trail Natural Gas Pipeline, which is 100 percent-owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise, is a new 134-mile, 24-inch pipeline that has the capacity to transport up to 1 Scfld of natural gas from the Independence Hub to an interconnect with Tennessee Gas Pipeline at West Delta block 68, a new platform also owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise. Independence Subsea consists of all the producer owned and operated facilities from the wells to tiebacks on the Independence Hub. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation, Dominion Exploration & Production and StatoilHydro own and operate the Independence Subsea facilities and production. The initial development of Independence Subsea includes 16 gas completions in 10 fields that are tied back subsea to the Independence Hub platform. The initial 10 anchor fields are located in the Atwater Valley (AT), Desoto Canyon (DC), Lloyd Ridge (LL), and Mississippi Canyon (MC) areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The longest subsea tie-back at Independence Hub is approximately 43 miles, but gas well subsea tiebacks can extend up to 60 to 75 miles from the host facility. The total miles of subsea flowlines associated with Independence Subsea is estimated at 210 miles. For more detailed information on the Independence Project see the Enterprise Product Partners website at www.epplp.com/projects/indProj.htm

Lynnel, at your request we have revised the agenda for the MMS presentation on Tuesday, with the day starting one-half hour earlier and ending at noon. MMS will be unable to provide lunch in-house because the Gulf Office will be in the middle of a move within the building. Because the new conference room will not yet be furnished and the old conference room will be stripped out, the morning presentations will be held in the Visualization Room and food and drink are not allowed in that room. MMS will provide transportation somewhere for everyone to get lunch and then get the group to the next local location on your schedule. We look forward to receiving a list of participants. Thank you, Lyn Herdt MMS, Chief Office of Congressional Affairs 208-3502 (office)

Hi Alex, Per our phone conversation, I wanted to extend an invitation to Senator Menendez's staff to join an overview of the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Program we have scheduled with staff from the offices of Representatives Pallone and Holt. This briefing is scheduled for Friday, May 15, 2-3 pm, 1214 Longworth House Office Building. As I mentioned, we are also willing to schedule a separate briefing for the Senator and/or staff, but recognizing busy schedules we wanted to offer this opportunity. Thanks, Cheri

Also, Deborah , please provide everyone with any documents or further instructions they will need to record or report their actions in response to these FOIA requests. Based on discussions with the WP and NYT, the requests have been narrowed from the original attached letters (see discussion below) . The WP and NYT request are for communications (emails) to BOEM from a Member of Congress or congressional staff, or BOEM emails to a Member of Congress or congressional staff (WP for Jan 1, 2004 - April 19, 2010; NYT for June 10, 2007 - June 10, 2009) regarding BOEM's Offshore Energy and Minerals Management program. Responsive em ails are only those coming in from and those going out to Members of Congress or congressional staff; no internal emails. Please print all responsive emails and attachments into individual packages for each FOIA request. FIRST BATCH: The WP and NYThave asked that we provide the documents in batches; the first batch for both the WP and NYT will cover January 1, 2009 through April 19, 2010. Responsive emails for these first batches for the WP and NYTshould be provided as soon as possible, but no later than October 8,2010 (delivery instructions will come from Deborah Kimball).

Melissa: Thank you for the message and your continued work on our request. I am glad to know that you are up to speed on my previous discussions with your colleagues and the previous revisions we have made to our FOIA request at their request.

In the interest of further reducing the workload and speeding the release of documents, please consider this a further revision of our request to include these items:
-- Please construe the request to cover direct communications only. In the case of e-mail messages, please include only messages where a BOEMlMMS staff member is listed in the To: or From: fields. -- Please send us only one copy of an email instead of duplicates in instances where multiple BOEMlMMS staffers are involved. However, in such cases we request disclosure of the names of all staff members who received the communications. -- Please release materials to us as they are identified, without waiting for all material to have been gathered. Please work back from the most recent communications, and begin with materials in the January 1, 2009, to April 19, 2010, time period. Please release those materials to us when they are available. -- Please exclude communications that deal exclusively with appropriations and budget issues as they relate to MMS operations. Please include communications that refer to appropriations and budget issues but also include other requests or which address other subjects and concerns. As regards former BOEMlMMS employees, could you tell me how many former employees would be covered by such an exclusion? We would be happy to reassess the scope of this request after receiving materials from the January 1, 2009, to April 19, 2010, time period.

Thank you again for the time and effort on this request.

MAY 0 4 2009

Tbe Honorable Mike Coffman House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Mr. Coffman: Thank you for your letter dated March 5,2009, cosigned by your colleagues, supporting the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Lease Sale 208 in the Cenh'al Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. On March 18,2009, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) held Sale 208, as scheduled. I was honored to participate in Sale 208 and publicly aJillounced the bidding results. The MMS received 476 bids on 348 tracts, offering $703 million in high bids, demonstrating the continued interest industry has in the Central Gulf of Mexico. Evaluation of the high bids to ensure fair market value has already begun. 1 recently met with the American public on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, as well as in Alaska, to get input that will help ensure that we develop the right kind of energy in the right places on the

oes.

The security of our energy supply and stability of energy prices remain significant COl1cems for the Nation . Even as the Depat1ment of the Interior aggressively pursucs renewable energy oppoliunities, domestic production of oil and gas is crucial, including oil and natural gas from the oes. The need to continue to produce our traditional domestic energy resources and develop renewable energy resources, while remaining responsible stewards of our environment has never bcen greater. Again, thank you for sharing your concems with me.

The Honorable Bob Goodlatte House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congressman Goodlattc: Thank you for your lettcr datcd February 3, 2009, to Prcsident Obama, cosigned by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that arcas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be left opcn for oil and gas exploration and development while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore dril1ing plan. As Acting Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), I have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. The Administration and the Department ofthe Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority. In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in more areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2010-2015 does not affect the current leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the current program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision ofthe 10th Circuit Conrt, which found that the current offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concem. Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible. If any Member of Congress has particular suggestions or comments related to the new 5-year plan now in progress, please be aware that we are accepting comments until September 21,2009. We welcome any suggestions or comments you may have regarding the deVelopment of a comprehensive energy program for the OCS and the Nation. Thank you for your interest in the offshore energy program. We look forward to working with you on this issue. If you have any questions, please contact me at (202) 208-3500, or Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS Office of Congressional Affairs, at (202) 208-3502.

The Honorable Lynn Jenkins House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congresswoman Jenkins: Thank you for your letter dated February 3,2009, to President Obama, cosigned by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be left open for oil and gas exploration and development while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore drilling plan. As Acting Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), I have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your Jetter. The Administration and the Department of the Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority. In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in more areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 20102015 does not affect the cutTent leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The 1110st recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the current program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision of the 10th Circuit Court, which found that the cunent offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concern. Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible. If any Member of Congress has particular suggestions or comments related to the new 5-year plan now in progress, please be aware that we are accepting comments until September 21,2009. We welcome any suggestions or comments you may have regarding the development of a comprehensive energy program for the OCS and the Nation. Thank you for your interest in the offshore energy program. We look forward to working with you on this issue. If you have any questions, please contact me at (202) 208-3500, or Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS Office of Congressional Affairs, at (202) 208-3502. Sincerely,

Walter D. Cruickshank Acting Director

Tbe Honorable Harold Rogers House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congressman Rogers: Thank you for your letter dated Febmary 3, 2009, to President Obama, cosigncd by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be left open for oil and gas exploration and development while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore drilling plan. As Acting Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), I have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. The Administration and the Department of the Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority. In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in more areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 201 ()-2015 does not affect the current leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the cutTenl program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision of the 10th Circuit Court, which found that the current offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concem . Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision ancl to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible.

The Honorable John Boozman House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congressman Boozman: Thank you for your letter dated Fcbmary 3, 2009, to President Obama, cosigned by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be leil open for oil and gas exploration and development while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore drilling plan. As Acting Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), I have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. The Administration and the Department of the Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority. In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in more areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 20W?-20lS does not affect the current leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the cun-ent program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision of the 10th Circuit Court, which found that the current offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concern. Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible. If any Member of Congress has particular suggestions or comments related to the new 5-year plan now in progress, please be aware that we are accepting comments until September 21, 2009 . We welcome any suggestions or comments you may have regarding the development of a comprehensive energy program for the OCS and the Nation. Thank you for your interest in the offshore energy program. We look forward to working with you on this issue. rfyol! have any questions, please contact me at (202) 208-3500, or Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS Offi.ce of Congressional Affairs, at (202) 208-3502.

The Honorable Bill Posey House of Representatives Washington, D.C . 20515 Dear Congressman Posey: Thank you for your letter dated February 3,2009, to President Obama, cosigned by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be left open for oil and gas exploration and development while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore drilling plan. As Acting Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), 1 have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. The Administration and the Department of the Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority. In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in more areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2010-2015 does not affect the current leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids . Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the current program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision of the 10th Circuit Court, which found that the current offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major conccm. Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible. If any Member of Congress has partiCUlar suggestions or comments related to the new 5-year plan now in progress, please be aware that we are accepting comments until September 21,2009. We welcome any suggestions or comments you may have regarding the development of a comprehensive energy program for the OCS and the Nation. Thank you for your interest in the offshore energy program. We look forward to working with you on this issue. If you have any questions, please contact me at (202) 208-3500, or Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS Office ofCollgressional Affairs, at (202) 208-3502.

The Honorable Todd Akin House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congressman Akin: Thank you for your letter dated February 3, 2009, to President Obama, cosigned by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be left open for oil and gas exploration and development while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore drilling plan. As Acting Director ofthe Minerals Management Service (MMS), 1 have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. The Administration and the Department of the Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority. In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in more areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2010-2015 does not affect the current leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the current program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision of the 10th Circuit Court, which found that the current offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concern. Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible.

If any Member of Congress has particular suggestions or comments related to the new 5-year plan now in progress, please be aware that we are accepting comments until September 21,2009. We welcome any suggestions or comments you 11lay have regarding the development ofa comprehensive energy program for the OCS and the Nation.
Thank you for your interest in the offshore energy program. We look forward to working with you on this issue. If you have any questions, please contact me at (202) 208-3500, or Ms. Lyn Herdt, Chief, MMS Office of Congressional Affairs, at (202) 208-3502. Sincerely,

Walter D. Cmickshank Acting Director

362879-mms6-pdf-45-90-98,"2 MMS is pleased to have the opportunity to present the Committee with information on the MMS Oil Spill Response Research Program and the operation of Ohmsett - The National Oil Spill Response Test Facility. Overview For more than 25 years, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) has maintained a comprehensive, long-term research program to improve oil spill response technologies. The major focus of the program is to improve the knowledge, technologies and methodologies used for the detection, containment and cleanup of oil spills that may occur on the OCS and disseminate findings through a variety of public forums such as workshops, conferences, peer-reviewed publications and the internet. The intent is to make this information widely available to oil spill response personnel and organizations world wide. The activities undertaken by the MMS oil spill response research (OSRR) program comply with the research and development provisions of Title VII in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90). The OSRR program provides research leadership to improve the capabilities for detecting and responding to an oil spill in the marine environment. In the past decade the OSRR program has been making progress in developing technological advances to improve the ability to clean up oil spills in Arctic environments. This includes development of systems, equipment and methodologies that can be used in extremely cold temperatures and in broken ice conditions. These advancements have allowed oil and gas exploration and development activities to move forward in Arctic offshore environments and will produce real cost savings. The OSRR program is a cooperative effort bringing together funding and expertise from research partners in government agencies, industry, and the international community to collaborate on oil spill research and development (R&D) projects. The OSRR program operates through contracts with universities, government agencies and laboratories and private industry to assess safety-related technologies and to perform necessary applied research. Funding for the OSRR program activities is appropriated from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF). MMS plans and implements OSRR projects that have multiple phases in a stepwise approach over several years, enabling the MMS to secure cooperative funding from private industry as well as countries that have offshore regulatory programs. The MMS OSRR program monitors and capitalizes on the efforts of other agencies and industry whenever possible through active partnering. More than 40 percent of the OSRR projects are Joint Industry Projects, where MMS partners with other stakeholders to maximize research dollars. The MMS coordinates oil spill research closely with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through participation on the National Response Team and on the Interagency Coordination Committee for Oil Pollution Research. This allows the MMS to foster collaborative research at the national and international level, optimize current and future research initiatives, minimize research duplication, and

3 ensure that MMS's interests are addressed. Partnering has reinforced the MMS's oil spill response research and development and encouraged oil spill technology development efforts by academia and industry. The MMS has participated in the exchange of technological information with Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Norway and the United Kingdom through cooperative research projects, workshops and technical meetings. Information derived from the OSRR program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used to make regulatory decisions pertaining to permitting and approving plans, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements. The MMS as well as US and foreign government agencies and organizations worldwide utilize the results from the OSRR program and Ohmsett in making planning, regulatory, and emergency response decisions. Current OSRR projects cover a wide spectrum of oil spill response issues and include laboratory, meso-scale and full-scale field experiments. Major topic areas include: Remote sensing and detection of spilled oil Physical and chemical properties of crude oil Mechanical containment and recovery Chemical treating agents and dispersants In situ burning MMS Oil Spill Response Research Success from the MMS OSRR program comes from a step-wise research approach to solve specific research needs that includes fonnation of joint industry projects to expand the scope and leverage program funds. Many significant technical advances in oil spill response can be attributed to successful multi-phase research projects that involve scientists worldwide. Applied research and the development of response strategies traditionally involve a combination of laboratory small-scale tests, meso-scale tank and basin experiments, and full-scale field trials. The MMS has used this approach to develop, initiate, and conduct more than 200 successful oil spill research projects. Once the MMS has identified a research need or data gap in spill response we initiate and conduct a scoping project to define the current state-of-the-art for this technology or methodology. The results from these scoping projects are used to develop a systematic approach required to successfully address the data need. Communicating the results from these projects to government agencies and private industry is the next step to build consensus on the future research direction. A carefully focused work plan or agenda encompassing a priority list ofprojects is developed. It is generally beyond the capabilities of anyone organization to fund these projects in their entirety. International cooperation, including governmental and industry participants, is needed to make substantial progress in the most important research and development areas. Given the specialized nature and limited number of researchers actively working on oil spill response, it is essential to involve different centers of expertise on a global scale. The MMS has initiated many successful joint industry projects (national or international) to leverage our program funds and expand the scope of the project to develop innovative or

4

new technological advancements to detect, contain, and cleanup oil spills in the marine environment.

Ohmsett - The National Oil Spill Response Test Facility The passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90) significantly expanded MMS's role in oil spill research. Title VII of OP A-90 mandated the reactivation of Ohrnsett The National Oil Spill Response Test Facility located in Leonardo, NJ. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research (created by OP A-90) delegated this responsibility to the MMS . Ohrnsett is the only facility in the world where full-sized oil spill response equipment can be tested and training of first responders can be conducted with a variety of oils in a simulated marine environment under controlled conditions. The primary feature of Ohrnsett is a large outdoor, above ground concrete test tank which measures 667 feet long (the approximate length of two football fields) by 65 feet wide, by 11 feet deep. It is filled with 2.6 million gallons of crystal clear salt water. Ohrnsett is also the premier training site for spill response personnel from state and federal government agencies, private industry and foreign countries. This includes the U.S . Coast Guard Strike Team personnel. MMS now manages Ohrnsett as part of its mandated requirements to ensure that the best and safest technologies are used in offshore oil and gas operations. On July 22, 2009, Ohmsett celebrated its 17th anniversary under MMS management and to date 24 countries have made use of the facility.
The facility provides an environmentally safe place to conduct objective, independent testing of oil spill response equipment as well as training responders. Many oftoday's commercially available oil spill cleanup products and services have been tested at Ohmsett either as off-the-shelf commercially available equipment, or as equipment or technology still under development. In North America, a large portion of existing independent performance data and information on containment booms and skimmers has been obtained through testing at Ohrnsett. The MMS has expanded the capabilities of Ohmsett to test all types of oil spill response equipment and techniques. The testing capabilities of Ohrnsett were recently upgraded to provide a simulated Arctic environment for cold water testing and training. This capability will allow Ohrnsett to remain operational year round, offering testing, training and research. We now have the ability to test and evaluate fire resistant containment booms using an air-injected propane burner system that realistically simulates in situ burning at sea. We have added the capability to conduct effectiveness testing on a variety of chemical treating agents, dispersants, emulsion breakers, and sorbent products. The use of chemical dispersants is another important option in oil spill response. The Ohmsett facility is a world leader in realistic dispersant effectiveness testing through the design and development of a calibrated, referenced and realistic test protocol and subsequent testing under cold and temperate conditions using fresh and weathered crude and fuel oils. The National Research Council strongly supported the use of wave tank testing in their recent review of chemical dispersants. Ohmsett is the world's largest wave-tank complex presently conducting such research, and is the logical venue for bridging the gap between laboratory and field testing.

5

The Ohmsett facility is developing the capability to conduct independent and objective performance testing of emerging marine renewable energy devices. The objective is to provide as realistic conditions in the model scale as possible including realistic parameters for wave heights, wave periods, and directional spreading water depth. The program includes the development of standard test protocols both nationally and internationally. Ohrnsett is an integral part of the MMS oil spill research program and is essential for fulfilling the agency's regulatory responsibilities under OP A-90. The facility directly supports MMS' s mission of ensuring safe and environmentally sound oil and gas development on the OCS. Ohmsett is not only an important component of the MMS oil spill research, it is also a national asset where government agencies, private industry and academia can conduct full-scale oil spill research and development programs in a controlled environment with real oil. Ohmsett allows research, testing and evaluation of equipment, systems and methodologies, and responder training to take place in a controlled environment.

Significant Accomplishments of the MMS Oil Spill Response Research Program
Following are some examples ofthe significant accomplishments of the MMS OSRR Program and how these new technological advances are currently being operationally used worldwide to respond to oil spills in the marine environment. 1. Detection of Oil In, On, and Under Ice The ability to detect reliably and map oil trapped in, under, on, or among ice is critical to mounting an effective response in Arctic waters. In the past, the only successful method for detecting the presence of oil in or under ice involved drilling holes through the ice sheet or by sending divers down under the ice to delineate the extent of a spill. This method is expensive, labor intensive, and exposes personnel to the vagaries of extreme weather.
In 1999, the MMS initiated a project to evaluate potential remote sensing techniques to detect oil trapped within and under ice. Of the many technologies recently reviewed, only ground penetrating radar (GPR) showed potential. Between 2003 and 2008 the MMS initiated four international joint industry projects to develop GPR into a functional remote monitoring sensor. Two of these projects conducted offshore Svalbard, Norway involved a permitted, intentional oil release for research purposes.

2. Oil Spill Thickness Sensor One of the most important initial steps in response to an oil spill at sea is the assessment of the extent of the oil slick and the quantity (i.e. thickness) distribution of oil within it. A critical gap in spill response is the lack of capability to measure and map accurately the thickness of oil on water and to rapidly send this information to response personnel in the cornmand post.

6

In testimony given before the Subcommittee, Mr. Doug Helton of NOAA, cited the need for remote sensing technologies during the Cosco Busan oil spill to detect oil effectively, determine areas of the thickest amounts of oil, and then use this information to direct skimming operations to increase the recovery of spilled oil. In November 2005, the MMS initiated a research project that would enable the measurement of oil slick thicknesses using multispectral aerial imagery. The California Department ofFish and Game, Oil Spill Prevention and Response (DFG/OSPR) partnered with MMS on this project and provided technical expertise with the Geographic Information System component of this project. Over a three-year period (2005-2008) the aerial mapping system was developed through a systematic approach which included many overflights of the Coal Oil Point, CA natural oil seeps. In November 2007, remote aerial sensing of the Cosco Busan oil spill was performed using the prototype thickness sensor mounted to a small plane and flown over the spill area to test the system under actual field conditions. The sensor performed as expected and could effectively identify the extent and high density areas of the spill. Under commercial application this aerial thickness sensor could have been used to prioritize clean-up activities. The full system integration flight of the aerial thickness mapping system was successfully completed in November 2008. On December 7, 2008, there was an oil spill from Platform A in the Santa Barbara channel due to a ruptured tank. The California Department of Fish and Game, Oil Spill Prevention and Response used the aerial thickness mapping system to acquire image data. The data was immediately processed and made available to the Unified Command center for guiding response operations. The data was used to recover successfully the spilled oil over a five day period and none of the oil hit the shoreline.

3. Mechanical Containment and Recovery in Arctic Ice Environments More than a decade of MMS research has focused on methods to improve the effectiveness of equipment and techniques for the mechanical recovery of oil spills in iceinfested waters. This research has substantially improved mechanical recovery of oil spills in Arctic environments. In October 2004, the MMS initiated a research project . with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to study the process of oil adhesion to the surface of oil skimmers and to identify parameters to improve their efficiency. Over a three year period (2004-2007), numerous laboratory, small and large scale tank tests were conducted to improve the mechanical recovery of oil. Research results demonstrated that changing the surface pattern of the drum will improve recovery efficiency by over 200%. The results from this research project were patented by UCSB and the principal investigator (PI). The PI was awarded her doctoral degree as a result of her research. There are at least six types of grooved skimmers being commercially sold around the world that resulted from this research. 4. In Situ Burn Research MMS was designated as the lead agency for in situ bum research (ISB) in the Oil Pollution Research and Technology Plan prepared under the authority of Title VII of the OPA-90. The use ofISB as a spill response technique is not new, having been researched

7

and employed in one form or another at a variety of oil spills since the 1960' s. Burning as a response tool for oil spills in broken ice has been researched since the early 1980' s using both tank tests and medium to large-sized experimental spills. Many scientists and responders believe this technique is among the best option for oil spill response in the Arctic, especially with a high degree of ice coverage. Between 1995 and 2003 , the MMS partnered with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to conduct more than ten different ISB research projects. To disseminate results of eight years of intensive ISB research, the MMS assembled a comprehensive compendium of scientific literature on the role of in situ burning as a response option for the control, removal and mitigation of marine oil spills. All operational aspects of burning are covered in detail. It contains more than 350 documents with over 13,000 pages and nearly one hour of video. The MMS has distributed more than 2,000 ISB-CD sets worldwide. In situ burning is now considered a viable countermeasure for offshore oil spills. Regional Response Teams (RRT) and Area Committees are integrating the use of in situ burning into their response protocols and contingency plans. Overall the opportunity for use, growing inventory of equipment resources and the trend for Federal On Scene Coordinators (FOSC ' s) and RRT's to seriously consider and more readily approve its use indicate an expanded role for in situ burning in the Arctic.

5. Dispersants in Cold Water/Broken Ice Environments The use of chemical dispersants in is another important option in oil spill response. The Ohmsett facility is rapidly becoming a world leader in realistic dispersant testing through the design and development of a calibrated, referenced and realistic test protocol and subsequent testing under cold and temperate conditions using a variety of crude and fuel oils. Ohmsett is the world' s largest wave-tank complex presently conducting dispersant research and is a logical venue for bridging the gap between laboratory and field testing. The National Research Council strongly supported the use of wave tank testing in their recent review of chemical dispersants. In the past seven years there have been fourteen major dispersant research projects conducted at Ohmsett. Experiments at Ohmsett have demonstrated that dispersants are effective in near-freezing water temperatures but this is highly dependent on the properties of the crude oil. Dispersants can be effective in broken ice if there is some mixing energy present (wind, waves, movement of ice floes caused by wind, waves, and currents). Dispersants can potentially provide an invaluable third response option when strong winds and sea conditions make mechanical cleanup and in situ burn techniques unsafe and/or ineffective.
Results from dispersant testing at Ohmsett are being used by local, state and federal regional response teams and regulators to support the use of dispersants as an oil spill response tool in their jurisdictions. Results from dispersant testing in cold waterlbroken ice conditions at Ohmsett have been used by industry to gain regulatory approval for the use of this countermeasure for the Sakhalin Island project in Russia and for planned projects in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.

8
6. Chemical Herders Spilled oil rapidly spreads on the waters' surface into very thin slicks. Chemical herders have the ability to quickly clear oil films from the waters' surface. The intention of herding is to thicken oil slicks sufficiently to allow them to be cleaned up with conventional mechanical containment systems or through the use of in situ burning or the use of dispersants.
Since 2004, the MMS and ExxonMobil have jointly funded research to evaluate using herders to extend the window of opportunity for oil spill response options in Arctic environments. Research efforts have focused on the use of herders to thicken oil slicks in broken ice to allow them to be effectively ignited and burned. Three years of laboratory, small and large scale tank tests were completed. In May 2008, two full scale bum experiments were successfully conducted during an intentional oil spill exercise offshore Svalbard, Norway. In February 2009, the MMS conducted research on the use of herders to improve the efficiency of mechanical containment and recovery systems. More than 400,000 pounds of ice was delivered to Ohrnsett for these experiments. Research on the use of herders to expand the use of dispersants will be conducted at the Ohmsett facility in October 2009.

Oil Spill Response Research Outreach
The MMS collaborates with state, federal and international governmental agencies, organizations, and private industry to coordinate oil spill response research and Ohmsett testing. We also participate in international, regional and local conferences, workshops and meetings to present the results ofMMS funded OSRR projects. We publish and disseminate the results of OSRR projects as widely as possible in peer reviewed scientific papers and articles, in technical journals and reports and in public information documents. The MMS sponsors and participates in Arctic related oil spill response workshops and conferences to disseminate results from the OSRR program and from Ohrnsett testing, training and research activities to the public. The MMS maintains a website that contains a listing of all Arctic OSRR projects funded by the MMS as well as downloadable reports and film clips free of charge. The Ohrnsett facility also plays an important role in environmental outreach by informing the oil spill community of oil spills, environmental contamination, cleanup methods and testing. Ohrnsett's recently renovated conference room enables various federal, state, academic and private organizations to conduct on-site committee meetings and conferences. Facility tours and presentations are given upon request. Regular attendance at both U.S. and international environmental conferences plays an important role in getting the infonnation, the analysis and the results achieved from the research projects to the pUblic. Publication of The Ohrnsett Gazette, the facility's semi-annual newsletter, keeps the oil spill community abreast ofrecently conducted facility activities. Ohmsett's website describes the testing that the facility conducts and gives objective results of the research conducted. Staff members also participate in environmental education projects such as

9

school science fairs, college work study programs, and student mentorship programs. Through this type of public interaction, Ohmsett is able to increase public awareness by educating the community of the importance of marine safety and environmental protection.

The MMS Environmental Studies Program (ESP)
In addition to the Oil Spill Response Research, MMS also conducts the Environmental Studies Program which is designed to gather scientific information needed for stewardship of coastal and marine environments as we manage the development of OCS energy and minerals. A component of this broad-based program focuses on the collection and development of scientific information needed to understand and predict the fates and effects of potential oil spills from these OCS activities. The MMS assesses oil-spill risks associated with offshore energy activities on the OCS by calculating spill trajectories and contact probabilities. These analyses address the likelihood of spill occurrences, the transport and fate of any spilled oil, and the environmental impacts that might occur as a result of the spill. The MMS Oil-Spill Risk Analysis (OSRA) Model combines the probability of spill occurrence with a statistical description of hypothetical oil-spill movement on the ocean surface. Paths of hypothetical oil spills are based on hindcasts (history) of winds, ocean currents, and ice in arctic waters, using the best available input of environmental information. The research to support the oil-spill risk analyses includes scientific observations of the ocean surface circulation in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Santa Barbara Channel and Santa Maria Basin offshore Southern California, and in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas off Alaska. In addition, MMS has sponsored development of ocean surface circulation models in these areas, as well as most recently in the mid-Atlantic OCS area, to provide input for OCS lease sale environmental analyses. As the oil and gas industry moved into deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, we also undertook research to characterize the deepwater current movements in the Gulf of Mexico to assist our assessment of a possible release of oil from these ocean depths. In Alaska, we have sponsored research to better describe the weathering of oil on snow and ice, and we have sponsored field studies and modeling of sea ice - ocean movement and the interaction with spilled oil. The Environmental Studies Program research management philosophy always seeks out partners, and much ofthe research described is linked to programs in NOAA and NASA, as well as cooperative efforts with key universities in the affected States. The MMS is committed to the continuous improvement of OSRA estimations and environmental impact statements (EIS) analyses, and uses the results of new observation and modeling to better manage OCS oil and gas development. As offshore activity expands into deeper waters and new geographic areas, MMS oil-spill modeling will be applied to pertinent risk assessments and validated with environmental observations. Modeling results are used by MMS staff for preparation of environmental documents in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act; other Federal and State agencies

10

for review of EISs, environmental assessments, and endangered species consultations; and oil industry specialists preparing the oil spill response plans.

Conclusion
Mr. Chairman, this concludes MMS's prepared statement. Thank you for the opportunity to present an overview of the MMS's oil spill response research program and the Ohmsett facility. The program directly supports the MMS mission of ensuring safe and sound operations on the OCS and has made substantive technological advances in the ability to detect, respond and cleanup oil spills in the marine environment. MMS would be happy to respond to any questions.

362878-mms6-pdf-44-89-89,"Statement of Minerals Management Service Department of the Interior Before the Committee on Science and Technology Subcommittee on Energy and Environment U.S. House of Representatives ""A New Direction for Federal Oil Spill Research and Development"" June 4,2009
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is the bureau within the Department of the Interior responsible for the management of the Nation's renewable energy, oil, natural gas, and other mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) as well as the energy and mineral revenues from the OCS and from Federal onshore and American Indian lands. From the gasoline that powers our cars, the natural gas that heats our homes, and the benefits obtained through the disbursement of collected mineral revenues, the Nation and its citizens benefit from the efforts of the MMS. The MMS has jurisdiction over approximately 1.7 billion acres of the OCS, on which there are about 8,100 active oil and gas leases. We work with other federal agencies, state and local governments, industry, and academia to achieve a common objective to maintain high standards for safety and the environment and to meet national economic, security and energy policy goals. The OCS is a significant source of oil and natural gas for the Nation's energy supply, providing about 14 percent of domestic natural gas production and 27 percent of domestic oil production. MMS recently published the final rulemaking that provides the framework to grant leases, easements and rights of way for the orderly, safe, and environmentally responsible development of renewable energy resources on the oes such as wind, wave, and ocean current. The MMS has a robust regulatory system designed to prevent accidents and oil spills associated with oes oil and gas exploration and production. However, whenever oil is being handled - whether in tankers, pipelines, or production facilities, whether onshore or offshore, and whether in the US or abroad - spills are a possibility. For that reason it is imperative that US and international agencies work together to prepare for oil spills in a comprehensive manner. This preparation includes continued improvement in response technology and procedures.

The Honorable Jerry Moran House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congressman Moran: Thank you for your letter dated February 3,2009, to President Obama, cosigned by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be left open for oil and gas exploration and development while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore drilling plan. As Acting Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), 1 have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. Thc Administration and the Depaltment of the Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority. In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in 1110re areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 201 0-2015 does not affect the current leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the cuncnt program. We recognize tbat the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. 'rhe recent decision of the 10th Circuit Court, which found that the cunent offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concern. Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible.

The Honorable Marsha Blackburn House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congresswoman Blackburn: Thank you for your letter dated February 3,2009, to President Obama, cosigned by 69 other Members of Congress, urging that areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) be left open for oil and gas exploration and developulcnt while the Administration reviews the 5-year offshore drilling plan. As Acting Director of the Minerals Management Selvice (MMS), I have been asked to respond. A similar letter is being sent to each signer of your letter. The Administration and the Depmtment of the Interior have made developing a comprehensive energy strategy for the Nation a top priority, In fact, as a result of the decision by Congress not to renew the OCS moratorium last year, we are exploring offshore oil and gas development in more areas than ever before. Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar's decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 20102015 docs not affect the current leasing program. In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program, The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the current program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent ofthe natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision of the 10th Circuit COUlt, which found that the current offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concern. Consequently, the Department is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible. If any Member of Congress has palticular suggestions or comments related to the new 5-year p.lan now in progress, please be aware that we are accepting comments until September 21,2009. We welcome any suggestions or comments you may have regarding the development of a comprehensive energy program for the OCS and the Nation. Thank you for your interest in the offshore energy program.

Let me assure you that Secretary Ken Salazar' s decision to extend the comment period on the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas LeasingProgram for 2010 ??2015 docs not affect the current leasing program . In fact, to date, seven sales have been held under this program. The most recent sale was Central Gulf Sale 208, which received over $700 million in high bids. Fourteen lease sales remain on the schedule under the current program. We recognize that the OCS continues to playa major role in the energy mix for our country and provides 27 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the natural gas produced domestically. The recent decision of the 10th Circuit Court, which found that the current offshore leasing plan is deficient, is a major concern. Consequently, the Depattment is working hard to clarify the implications of that decision and to remedy the situation with as little impact as possible. If any Member of Congress has pmticular suggestions or comments related to the new 5-year plan now in progress, please be aware that we are accepting comments until September 21,2009. We welcome any suggestions or comments you may have regarding the development of a comprehensive energy program for the OCS and the Nation. Thank you for your interest in the offshore energy program . We look forward to working with you on this issue.

Hi Ms. Herdt: I have a few questions I was hoping you or someone there at MMS could answer that a constituent has asked me about. What is the status of the following permits:

MC 941 #3 - Q2 (completion) Company notes it has a completion permit MC 941 #4 - Q3 (deepening total depth & completion) Company notes it has a drilling permit from the initial drill and that it would have to get a reentry permit which they think is customary MC 942 #2 - Q4 (deepening total depth & completion) Company notes it has a drilling permit from the initial drill and that it would have to get a reentry permit which they think is customary Also, we have a few general questions: 1. Why did the DOlor White House stop short of halting all Gulf oil operations. In other words, they could have stopped everything (drilling+completion) and instead they are just putting the moratorium on the drilling. Why? Are they afraid of oil price hikes, etc? 2. What does the 001 mean by ""Completion Operations?"" What is the technical definitions being used by MMS? Could we talk to someone at MMS and give them a specific well and ask them if they would consider it in the phase of ""completion operations?"" 3. Is there any chance that DOlor the White House would halt all operations? What would have to happen for that to occur?
Thanks, I appreciate it much! -Josh Joshua Gifford Legislative Assistant Congressman Allen Boyd

Consequences of Pending Lapse of the 27-Year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Leasing Moratorium as of September 30, 2008
All Pacific Coast and Atlantic Coast states would be opened as near as three miles from the shoreline to federal offshore leasing, conducted by the Minerals Management Service (MMS), in the event that the longstanding congressional moratorium is allowed to lapse at midnight on September 30, 2008. Because the current MMS Five-Year OCS Leasing Program is presently in the process of an unprecedented revision by the Department of Interior, it is very probable that any coastal waters where the moratorium is lifted would be promptly targeted for federal offshore leases in this new Revised OCS Program. The most prospective subsea geology that MMS would likely add to their Revised OCS Program would include all of the Mid-and-South Atlantic states (a pending Virginia offshore drilling proposal is already included as a ""contingent sale"" in the current MMS OCS Program), Massachusetts' Georges Bank fishing grounds (where prior drilling plans initially triggered the first legislative moratorium in fiscal year 1982), Northern California's Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, and nearshore Southern California, particularly within Santa Monica Bay, along the Palos Verdes Peninsula, near the Orange County Coast, and immediately adjacent to La Jolla. Because the White House has already recently rescinded the Executive OCS Deferrals for these same areas, the pending lapse of the congressional moratorium will leave no protection whatsoever remaining in place to give Congress and affected states any meaningful future role in influencing decisions about offshore drilling going forward in any location requested ofMMS by the oil and gas industry.

Rapid Inclusion of Sensitive Coastal Waters in Revised MMS OCS Leasing Program, Only Three Miles From Shore:
While it appears somewhat unlikely that all environmental documents necessary for finalizing their Revised Five-Year OCS Leasing Program could be completed and approved by MMS by the end of the Bush Administration, the agency could, within this timeframe, proceed to publish and finalize a revised chart of planned lease sales, designating the size, timing, and location of the new lease sales set for former moratorium waters. MMS would have no constraints on how close to shore these leases could be placed, as long as they lie beyond the 3-mile state waters boundary that characterizes all coastal states (with the exception of the Gulf Coast of Florida and the shoreline of Texas, where the state waters extend 9 miles from shore). The current Five-

Year OCS Leasing Program covers the period from 2007 to 2012, while the Revised Five-Year OCS Leasing Program now in preparation is slated to extend from mid-2010 to mid-2015, creating an overlap of approximately two years in the two Program timeframes.

Only Florida's Eastern Gulf of Mexico Protection Continues, Until 2022:
No new additional OCS leasing in protected areas of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico would result from the expiration of the existing annual legislative moratorium which affects the waters South of 26 degrees North Latitude in that region. Broader, redundant legislative protection, in the form of the pre-existing federal law called the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of2006 (GOMESA 06) would continue to protect waters extending from the Florida Gulf Coast out to the ""military mission line"" until 2022, absent future authorizing legislation that might supercede that ongoing protection. The underlying result of GOMESA would be the continuance of a buffer preventing new offshore drilling in federal waters extending approximately 234 miles from shore at a point due west of Tampa, and from 125 to 150 miles from shore on all other portions of Florida's Gulf Coast and Panhandle. In consideration of the protection afforded by the prior 2006 enactment of GOMESA, 8.2 million acres of previously-protected federal OCS waters in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico were opened to offshore leasing this year (2008) and attracted very high industry interest.

Disposition of U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries:
The relatively small areas now designated as National Marine Sanctuaries would continue to be protected by the very limited remaining executive OCS leasing deferrals left in place when the White House recently lifted these deferrals elsewhere, but such remaining executive protection for Sanctuaries is offered only for an ""indefinite period of time"". In general, most National Marine Sanctuaries already include a ""permanent"" ban on OCS leasing and drilling activities in their Designation Documents and in their Sanctuary Management Plans (although individual management plans are subject to periodic review and revision). Outside of GOMESA waters on Florida's Gulf Coast, the limited areas within National Marine Sanctuary boundaries, and two miniscule ""exclusion zones"" off of the City of Santa Barbara and Pt. Reyes in Marin County on the California coast, all federal OCS waters could be opened to drilling at the sole discretion of the Secretary of Interior and MMS upon expiration of the congressional moratorium.

Rapid Offshore oes Leasing While Royalty-Forgiveness Providing Free Oil and Gas to the Oil Industry Remains and Expands into Fragile Alaska Waters:
All coastal federal waters nationwide, including Florida's East Coast (where there appears to be insufficient petroleum industry interest, however), could be expected to be

included in any new lease sales that MMS decides to propose. Coastal states could reasonably expect a pre-lease planning time line of approximately 18-24 months, at a minimum, between the approval of a federal lease sale at MMS and the actual sale of seafloor lands and drilling rights to the oil industry in a lease sale. MMS' initial consultations with the petroleum industry, a process known as the ""Call for Nominations"" or the ""Call for Infonnation"" would provide MMS with the general outline of where industry would like to explore. Using this industry infonnation, based on geophysical surveys conducted with towed arrays of high-intensity ""airguns"", MMS would design and execute an initial lease sale, and generally one or two follow-up ""reoffering sales"" in the same OCS planning area, until all prospective federal tracts are leased. Royalty forgiveness provisions remain in effect throughout the Gulf of Mexico waters open to leasing, and additional new OCS royalty forgiveness provisions were enacted for many Alaskan ""frontier"" waters as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EP AC 05).

Irreversible OCS Leasing Process, Future ""Buybacks"" Unlikely:
While there are past precedents involving prior federal ""buybacks"" (or repurchase) of OCS leases in sensitive and controversial areas in Alaska's fishery-rich Bristol Bay, on Florida's Gulf Coast, and on North Carolina's Outer Banks, it is highly improbable that any newly-leased OCS tracts in fonner moratorium waters would ever again be subjected to similar buybacks.

Role of Coastal States and Governors Constrained, and Primarily Only Advisory:
The minimal fonnal advisory role provided to the governors of affected adjacent coastal states in commenting on federal OCS leasing actions is narrowly constrained by the OCS Lands Act as Amended (OCSLAA), and is essentially non-binding and consultative in nature. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides coastal states with federally-approved Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMP's) some jurisdictional authority over siting of onshore industrial facilities necessary to support offshore drilling, but states have little real leverage with respect to the actions undertaken by MMS where the leasing of federal offshore tracts is concerned. (see California v. Watt case, US Supreme Court, 1981).

Changes in Coastal Environment and Economics:
The sudden transition from legislative protection under the congressional moratorium first instituted in fiscal year 1982, to the same sensitive waters enjoying no executive or legislative protection at all, is likely to precipitate dramatic and permanent changes in coastal land use patterns, adversely impact nearshore water quality, and provide a major cumulative decline in onshore air quality, while generally unfavorably affecting coastal economies based on commercial fishing and tourism.

Litigation On Behalf of Coastal States Can Buy Time, But Not Stop Leasing Permanently:
In the past, occasional litigation pursued by coastal states, shoreline counties, interested

NGO interveners, and in Alaska, subsistence user groups, to protect their interests in federal OCS leasing and development decisions has generally proven to have the capacity to delay, but not permanently preclude, OCS-related federal actions and oil industry activities. Significant space-use conflicts between irreplaceable military exercise areas critical to Department of Defense national security activities remain unresolved throughout the federal OCS, in particular off of Virginia, New England, Washington State, Southern California, and in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico (where such DOD uses are addressed by GOMESA only until 2022).

Once Federal OCS Protection Has Lapsed, Future Efforts To Restore Congressional Moratorium Will Be Problematic:
Securing and maintaining congressional protection for America's coastal waters has never been an easy legislative task. The initial implementation of the first congressional OCS moratorium during calendar year 1981, for fiscal year 1982, presented challenges at each level of the legislative process. The addition of a new legislative moratorium for Alaska's North Aleutian Basin in 1991 only succeeded due to the national outrage generated by the futile cleanup efforts following the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, and that legislative moratorium protection was subsequently rescinded by the Congress in 2003, followed by the lifting of executive deferrals for the same area in January of 2007 by the White House. The fishing grounds of Bristol Bay were then immediately included in the current Five-Year oes Leasing Program with a lease sale scheduled for 201l. Absent a major U.S. oil spill, uncontrollable blowout, or other cataclysmic pollution event, it is highly unlikely that, once allowed to lapse, any future congressional OCS moratorium can ever be reinstated. The prior annual renewal of the legislative OCS moratorium has always been of a bipartisan nature and has continued without interruption during past Republican-led sessions of Congress, with even President Bush supporting renewal of the OCS moratorium as recently as his January 2008 budget document. In spite of this, the Minority Leadership is currently planning several high-profile public events on and around the September 30 expiration date of the current OCS moratorium, to try to place partisan blame on the Democratic Majority for heretofore blocking drilling in coastal waters and to declare what is being mischaracterized as ""Energy Independence Day"". This public relations effort is intended to maximize political benefits to Minority candidates and also to try to preclude future legislative or executive efforts to ever reinstate the OCS moratorium in any region in the future.

Christa, Anita is out today and your message came to me. While we disagree with FERC's interpretation of the law, we continue to move through the rulemaking process and plan on publishing a final rule by the end of the year. Senior Departmental management has reached out to FERC's leadership and are hopeful for a positive resolution to this situation. Thank you for inviting MMS up to meet with you and your colleagues on the OCS alternative program. We will keep in touch on this and other issues.

Maureen, Anita, and Will, Thank you again for all the information you provided us about MMS' role in regulating offshore wind projects. I was wondering if you had any further information about the recent FERC announcement that FERC would regulate DCS development - it seems limited to wave power. Is that how you understand it? What effect would that have on offshore wind projects that incorporate wave energy capturing technology into their turbine systems? If you have insight into this, please let me know. And if there are any other developments regarding FERC and MMS with OCS issues, please keep us in the loop! Many thanks, Christa

Atlantis Project
Considered one of BP's most technically challenging projects ever, the Atlantis platform is currently one of the deepest moored floating dual oil and gas production facilities in the world and weighing in at 58,700 tons, it is also one of the largest. BP is operator of Atlantis with 56% ownership with its partner in the venture, BHP Billiton, having a 44% working interest. The platform is located 190 miles south of New Orleans in Green Canyon Block 787 in 7,070ft (2, 150m) of water, the field itself occupying five blocks - Green Canyon 699, 700, 742, 743 and 744 - with water depths ranging between 4,400ft and 7,100ft (1,338m and 2,158m). Atlantis has a production capacity of 200,000 barrels of oil and 180 million cubic feet of gas per day. The field has an estimated life of 15 to 20 years and original recoverable oil reserves of more than 600 million barrels of oil equivalent. The Atlantis platform employs an integrated semi-submersible design, with the Production Quarters (PQ) platform supported by a separate dedicated Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU). In addition to the semi-submersible platform, field development uses a network of wet-tree subsea wells - with the potential for more than 18 to be tied back to Atlantis - while development drilling and well completion involve Transocean's semi-submersible rig, GSF Development Driller II, a Long-Term Development Unit (LTDU). Transporting the oil and gas to existing shelf and onshore interconnections uses the Caesar and Cleopatra pipelines, respectively, which form part of the largestcapacity deep-water line ever built - the Mardi Gras transportation system which is 65% BP-owned. BHP Billiton has a 25% equity share in the component Caesar pipeline and a 22% stake in Cleopatra.

Edison Chouest Offs hore C-Port
Though innovations in marine transportation have totally transformed the industry, one thing has remained constant. Eventually every vessel must return to port. Introducing C-Port - a one-of-a-kind, multi-service marine complex which represents the cutting edge evolution of marine materials movement and vessel support technology. C-Port stands as the hub of Port Fourchon, the Gulf of Mexico's premier deepwater port. Purpose-designed to reduce port turnaround time, the two CPort terminals comprise 18 specialized slips, configured to safely and efficiently transfer cargo, and provide a wide range of support services to accommodate the largest of deepwater offshore vessels. C-Port is a revolutionary concept which has raised the bar on marine terminal innovation and service, a complete one-stop center and a single-source solution which pushes the envelope of efficiency in deepwater materials movement. Every facet of C-Port is designed to quickly service vessels and return them safely to sea, all under the umbrella of a safety program nationally recognized as one of the best in the business. The management of C-Port is a seasoned and motivated team of industry professionals with years of experience. They're backed by a corporate philosophy with a rock-solid commitment to complete and total client satisfaction. For more information on C-Port see Edison Chouest Offshore website. www.chouest.com/C-PortlCPortlntroduction.html

Greater lafourche Port Commission - ""The Gulf's Energy Connection""
The Greater Lafourche Port Commission was established by the state of Louisiana in 1960 and exercises jurisdiction over an area of Lafourche Parish, south of the Intracoastal Waterway, including Port Fourchon and the South Lafourche Leonard Miller, Jr. Airport. The Greater Lafourche Port Commission, a political subdivision of the state of Louisiana, facilitates the economic growth of the communities in which it operates by maximizing the flow of trade and commerce. We do this to grow our economy and preserve our environment and heritage. The Commission has targeted Port Fourchon for growth and development of Port facilities because of its ideal geographic location on the Gulf Coast. Fourchon's primary service market is domestic deepwater oil and gas exploration, drilling and production in the Gulf of Mexico. Fourchon was initially comprised of 600 developed acres that house state of the art service facilities, and has been expanded to include a 700 acre Northern Expansion, which doubled the port's size and will further accommodate the industry's growing needs. In addition to developing Fourchon, the Commission has expanded the services of the South Lafourche Leonard Miller, Jr. Airport since acquiring it in November 2001. This general aviation airport sits on 359 acres in Galliano, Louisiana and is surrounded by 1,200 acres of commission-owned property slated for industrial development. Its close proximity to Fourchon makes it the airport of choice for both business and recreational travel to South Louisiana. The airport is under aggressive expansion as well, with plans for a 6,500-foot runway with a full parallel taxiway to accommodate large jet aircraft. Port Fourchon, Louisiana's only port on the Gulf of Mexico, is located at the mouth of Bayou Lafourche in Lafourche Parish. Road access to Port Fourchon is via LA 1 and LA 3090. Also located just 30 miles from Port Fourchon is the South Lafourche Leonard Miller, Jr. Airport on Airport Road off of Hwy 308 in Galliano, LA. For more information on Greater Lafourche Port Commission see websites below: www.portfourchon.com/ http://portsoflouisiana.org/documents/port profiles/Lafourche.pdf

Attachments: Status of Refunds for DWRR Leases - 3-31-10 .pdf
Morgan, attached is an update on the status of refunds to companies. MMS has refunded $1.057 billion so far. Refunds to-date have not included interest due the company . MMS gave the companies the option of choosing when they applied for a refund to recoup their refund against future royalties due or to receive a check for the total amount. When MMS has completed their research to determine the correct amount of a refund due a company, recoupmenVdistribution takes place per the company's request. MMS will calculate the interest based on the final refund amount and will arrange for recoupmenVdistribution at a later date. MMS's goal is to complete research on all requests for refunds by June 30, 2010, and complete all refunds and interest distributions by the end of the FY. Deep Water Royalty Relief Act leases issued in CY 1996 - 2000 had 10 year primary terms. Leases that are not producing or not under an approved suspension (or part of a unit that is not producing or not under an approved suspension) prior to the end of the primary term will expire by the end of CY 2010. o There are 250 active DWRR leases (subject of Kerr McGee litigation) as of the end of February , 2010, covering 1.43 million acres. o There are 79 companies with partial or full shares of one or more of these 250 leases. o 70 leases covering 0.398 million acres are producing or are held under an Suspension of Operations (SOP) o 30 additional leases covering 0.17 million acres are part of a producing unit. Of the remaining 150 o 60 leases covering 0.3 million acres have been explored but did not produce o 90 leases covering 0.514 million acres have not been explored .

Morgan, attached is the dear payor letter sent following the Supreme Court's decision to deny the government's petition, and a list of companies that will be getting refunds . The estimated total refund amount, including accrued interest through FY 2009 , was $2,135,669,883.92. Companies are recouping against royalties owed through March 2010. However, because the Government is required to pay interest on overpayments, for those companies that has not recouped their total refund by the end of March 2010, MMS will issue a check for the remaining amount. For those companies who do not have sufficient royalty stream , MMS is issuing a check. If you need additional information, please let me know.

Dear Reporter:

6 2009

The purpose of this lener is to inform you that on October 5, 2009. the United States Supreme Court denied the government's petition for a \\Tit of certiorari relating to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's decision (Decision) in favor of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor-in-interest to Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corporation) involving royalty relief on deep water leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas CDlp. r. Allred 554 F.3d 1082 (5 th Cir. 2009), eel't. denied. 2009 U.S. LEXIS 6035 (U.S. Oct. 5, 2009) (No. 0830069). [n its Decision, the Fifth Circuit held that the Department of the Interior does not have authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. 43 U.S.C.A. ? 1337 (West. Supp. 2007), to impose royalty relief price thresholds on leases located in the Gulf of :vfexico in deep water and issued between November 28, 1995, and November 28. 2000 (Leases). As a result, companies who have paid royalties on the Leases are entitled to recoup those royalties under 30 U.S.c. ? 1721a. If you have Leases subject to the Decision, submit a Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (FOtm MMS-2014) reversing all of your previously reported royalties using Adjustment Reason Code 10. FollO\ving this process \vill allow you to establish a credit balance against which future royalty obligations can be met. Use Transaction Code 41 to report the royalty-free volumes for sales periods through September 2008, and Transaction Code 55 for sales periods October 2008 forward. Tfthe process of recouping the royalties paid on your Leases will take longer than six months, you may request a refund under 30 U.S.c. ? 1721a (b). Your refund request must include the following: o o o o A statement that the refund is for qualifYlng Deep Water Royalty Relief Leases; The specific refund amount you are requesting; Your taxpayer identification number (TIN); and A properly completed Fornl MMS-2014 reversing the originally reported data.

[n addition, because the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, (Pub. L. 104-134), requires recipients of payments from the federal Govemment to receive the payments electronically, your refund request must also include: o o o o Your name: Your bank name. city. and State; Your 9-digit American Banking Association (ABA) number: and Your bank account number and account type (c-checking or s-savings).

Subject: RE: Kerr McGee Signed Dear Reporter Letter and Final Company List

Kathy , based on the expectation that all recoupments/refunds will be completed in FY 20 10, MMS accounted for the Kerr McGee recoupments ($2 .136B) in our latest OCS royalties estimates for FY 2010 from $S.425B to $3.28913. Does this help you? It's my understanding that the DOl budget office provided you with the revenue estimates and we recently provided you with the background data on production estimates . MMS budget office tells me that the revenue estimates for FY 2011 are not completed; awaiting further direction from OMB.

MMS is expecting all recoupments to be completed in FY 2010. If a company does not have sufficient royalty stream to recoup within 6 months the amount of royalties paid plus interest, on DWRR leases, they can request a refund and MMS will cut them a check.

Tom, I hope you had a fun and relaxing Holiday and this finds you at home taking it easy for a few more days. The first attachment presents Federal oil and gas revenues (onshore and offshore) by Calendar Year for 1998-2000 and by Fiscal Year for 2001-2009. The second attachment presents revenues disbursed to the US Treasury from offshore and onshore federal leases during the same 20-year period. These numbers include revenues from all commodities, not just oil and gas. If you need these numbers broken down to only oil and gas please let us know. Our technical staff responsible for the data mining tells us that this 2 nd step would be time consuming but doable by the end of January, 2010.

1Royalty Free Production is GOM production which is not subject to royalties because of the deep water royalty relief and deep gas royalty relief. Royalty relief price thresholds are expected to be exceeded in all forecast years for all deepwater royalty relief oil and gas except for production from Deep Water Royalty Relief Act leases sold from 1996 through 2000 for which price thresholds were not in effect (1998 and 1999) or were otherwise deemed not applicable (1996, 1997, 2000), and for natural gas production from deep water GOM leases acquired from August 2004 through 2006. Further, price thresolds are expected to be exceeded for all deep gas royalty relief except for Projection Years FY2010 and FY2011 for leases in 0 to 200 meters of water acquired after Sale 178 in 2001 through all sales in 2003. Finally, price thresholds are assumed not to be exceeded for deep gas royalty relief for leases in 0 to 200 meters of water acquired in sales in 2004 and beyond, including 2001-2003

Subject: RE: Request from Steve Feldgus----DOI Press Release: Salazar Conditionally Approves Shell's Exploration Plan Steve, here follows an excerpt from the Environmental Assessment for further clarification .

Shell proposes to drill exploration wells at up to three of five possible drill sites during the July-October 2010 open-water-drilling season. Three proposed drill sites (one per block) are located on three different blocks (6714, 6764, and 6912) in the Burger Prospect; one drill site is on a single block (6864) in the Crackerjack Prospect; and one drill site is on a single block (7007) in the SW Shoebill Prospect. The total number of wells that would be drilled in 2010 would depend on ice and weather conditions, the length of time available for drilling, and other factors affecting the time that it takes to drill each well. Based on past experience and current planning, Shell anticipates drilling up to three wells during the 2010 drilling season. Each of the five drill sites would be permitted for drilling in 2010 to allow for operational flexibility in the event sea ice conditions prevent access to one or more locations. Applications for Permits to Drill must be submitted to MMS for approval prior to drilling.

Linda, please see the following information and let me know if you have any questions. Lyn Herdt

Pursuant to EO 12777, EPA has authority for spill prevention and preparedness for nontransportation related onshore facilities. EPA requires Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plans for non-transportation related facilities. DOT has authority for spill prevention and preparedness for t ransportation related onshore facilities. DOT has spill pre ve ntion and response planning requirements for pipelines and other transportation-related facilities. All spills, onshore and o ffshore, must be reported to the National Response Center. EPA is responsible for directing a prompt and effective response to all onshore spills. The Coast Guard has similar responsibility for offshore spills. Spills The responsibility for response/cleanup of the spill resides with the polluter. Authority to oversee spill response/cleanup lies with the Coast Guard offshore and in the Coastal zone* as defined by the National Contingency Plan (NCP). EPA oversees response/cleanup in the Inland zone. Explicit delineation of boundaries are found in regional MOAs (between EPA and USCG) and in Area Contingency Plans or Regional Contingency Plans. The State participates as part of the unified command in overseeing response/cleanups. *Coastal zone as defined for the purpose of the NCP means all US waters subject to the tide, US waters of the Great Lakes, specified ports and harbors on inland rivers, waters of the contiguous zone, other waters of the high seas subject to the NCP and the land surface or land substrata, ground waters, and ambient air proximal to those waters. The term coastal zone delineates an area of federal responsibilities for response action. Precise boundaries are determined by EPA / USCG agreements and identified in federal regional contingency plans.

Attachments: Summary of OCS Royalty Relief Programs 11-4-09.doc; Deepwater Leases Chart 11-5-09.xls

Steve, For discussion, if we exclude the leasing experiments of 1978-1983 royalty relief was not included in lease terms until 1996, and the only royalty relief available prior to 1996 involved MMS approval of case-specific applications. By law prior to the DWRRA, the projects considered for royalty relief had to have been in production, and by regulation, those projects received royalty relief only if MMS did not expect them to continue to produce absent the royalty relief provided, as is the case for all of our need-based royalty relief programs. Accordingly, we would argue there was no anticipated net cost of royalty relief before 1996. Given the ad hoc and limited nature of the royalty relief program prior to 1996, we do not have a systematic data base that keeps track of the production amounts that were generated under different types of those royalty relief arrangements. Beginning in 1996, we have several data base systems which track the volumes (not the values) of royalty relief provided under various MMS and statutory programs . However, as is almost always the case with categorical type programs in which specific project need is not the basis for approval of royalty relief, we cannot say objectively how much of the royalty free production either was expected to be produced without the royalty incentive or was actually produced without the incentive. The calculation you propose below would represent a maximum royalty cost since some of the production would not have occurred absent relief and because some of the added production might be subject to paying some royalties, e.g., after the suspension volumes are reached. The actual calculations of the value of the royalty relief not only involve resource price levels that are not precisely equal to average annual levels taken from some publicly available index, but also require adjustments for project specific transportation and processing costs not available publicly in any form. However, attached is information on January - June 2009 natural gas and oil production from post 2000 leases with deep water relief, and January - June 2009 royalty-free natural gas production from leases with shallow water deep gas royalty relief. We will have the MRM numbers for you by November 28 th .

Department of the Interior Minerals Management Program November 4, 2009 OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF (OCS) ROYALTY RELIEF PROGRAMS MMS has implemented a variety of royalty relief programs to promote oil and natural gas development and production on the oes. Under need-based programs, long-standing owners of active leases must prove that their oil and gas related projects require some form of new or added royalty reduction or suspension to make their projector continued operations economically viable . Under incentive-based programs, potential and actual owners of leases within broad categories are encouraged to acquire and invest in risky oil and gas prospects in frontier or high cost areas by providing them with an opportunity to generate higher returns should they make a commercial discovery and subsequently develop and produce oil and gas from a lease within the designated category. Incentive-based relief generally results in Significant forgone royalty because it applies to all production resulting from a category of leases including any production which would have occurred under current conditions without relief. On the other hand, need-based relief is designed to prevent that fiscal cost by applying relief only to production that MMS determines would not occur otherwise. Substantial and sustained oil and gas price increases in recent years have reduced the role for both kinds of royalty relief. While lease contracts, regulations, and statutory mandates keep these programs in effect, price threshold provisions have largely resulted in the discontinuation of most forms of royalty relief, with the exception of those leases issued under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, as noted below. The current role of royalty relief is mainly to provide lessees with some insurance protection against a collapse of oil and gas prices.

Categories:
Deep Water Royalty Relief: The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA) of 1995 represents the most prominent application of incentive-base royalty relief. The DWRRA enhanced the competitiveness of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) relative to other investment opportunities available to the multinational oil industry. During the mandated five years following enactment of the DWRRA, GOM leases in water at least 200 meters deep were issued and became eligible for large, congressionally mandated royalty suspension volumes, under which oil and gas could be extracted and sold royalty free. The number of DWRRA leases sold, 3401 , was about four times greater than the aggregate level of deepwater leasing in the five years preceding DWRRA, and according to MMS estimates, resulted in 2,000 extra blocks being leased during the 1996-2000 period. About 300 of these DWRRA leases are still active and currently account for about fifteen percent of deepwater production. The DWRRA also established a need-based royalty relief program for deepwater leases issued before 1996 to stimulate investment in a large set of existing leases that had, for the most part, not commenced production. MMS devised a system to structure applications and conduct a comprehensive field evaluation to determine whether a given discovery that had not yet produced actually needed royalty relief to become economic. From 1997 through 2005, MMS evaluated nine applications, denying two and approving seven, but rescinding relief in two of the originally approved cases for non-performance. Price thresholds for these pre-DWRRA leases were set in statute at a level (about $38.08/bbl oil and $4.76/MMBtu gas expressed in 2009 dollars) that has suspended this relief every year since 2004 for oil and since 2000 for gas except for 2002. Since the price thresholds for oil and gas have been exceeded since 2004, applications for this form of need-based relief have ceased. Moreover, even if oil and gas prices should decline below threshold levels, there are not likely to be many remaining deepwater leases issued prior to 1996 that would still be eligible to apply for this form or relief, i.e., active but never produced. After the mandatory five-year leasing period under the DWRRA ended in 2000, MMS chose to continue incentive-based deepwater royalty relief for newly issued GOM leases in water at least 400 meters deep under the discretionary authority of the oes Lands Act, as amended by DWRRA.. However, the amount of this categorical relief was specified on a sale-by-sale basis , rather than set in the regulations. Also, MMS set much smaller suspension volumes than those set in the DWRRA, and reflected the fact that a large geologic field typically overlies multiple tracts as defined on the oes. These MMS suspension volumes were in fact set at less than one-fifth of those set in the DWRRA. They were also accompanied by similar or the same price thresholds as would apply under the DWRRA to deepwater leases issued prior to 1996 which qualified for need-based relief. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) directed that the royalty suspension volumes which MMS had used in lease sales since 2001 would continue to apply to all new leases in similar water depths issued in GOM sales through early August 2010. MMS was authorized to apply price threshold conditions at its discretion to these incentives, which it did by continuing with those

used under this program. EPAct also added another tier of royalty relief in the form of higher royalty suspension volumes than MMS had stipulated for leases to be issued in water depths of 2000 meters or greater. From 2001 through 2009, over 3900 additional deepwater leases have been issued in the GOM with this style categorical royalty relief and currently account for about three percent of deepwater production. In designing regulations and lease terms to implement the statutory provisions of the DWRRA, MMS was subject to two lawsuits for its interpretation that the Act allowed or implied certain important limiting conditions, e.g ., that relief would not apply to leases on fields that previously produced, that the amount of relief was to be shared by leases on the same field, and, that price thresholds stipulated in the DWRRA for the need-based program could be applied to the incentive- based program as well. The courts subsequently ruled against the Department's' position and judgment on all counts for the ways in which the oWRRA should be interpreted, i.e. , the way Congress meant or should have meant it to read, resulting in an estimated loss to tax payers of about $25 billion . Ironically and unfortunately, MMS had through administrative error inadvertently omitted price thresholds on oWRRA leases issued in 1998 and 1999. Both the Congress and the MMS Director requested investigations, and neither one found any intent by MMS employees or anyone else for that matter to purposely omit price thresholds . In the end, the courts' decisions that the DWRRA did not provide a price threshold authority for the incentive-based program made inclusion or omission of price thresholds by MMS in leases or regulations moot.

Alaska Royalty Relief: MMS has issued over 700 leases offshore Alaska with incentive-based royalty suspension volumes since 2003. The EPAct extended the authority to grant pre-production royalty relief following a discovery to existing leases offshore Alaska. Regulations detailing the case-by-case process used for need-based royalty relief in the GOM were revised in 2008 , based on the provisions in EPAct, to apply to leases offshore Alaska as well. Deep Gas Royalty Relief: MMS initiated an incentive-based royalty relief program in 2001 for newly issued leases aimed at production of gas from deep wells at least 15,000 feet subsea on leases in the shallow waters of the GOM . While shallow water in the GOM is not by itself a frontier area like deepwater or offshore Alaska , promising reservoirs at these deep depths in shallow water are expensive to drill and largely unexplored . Since 2001, MMS has issued leases in water less than 200 meters deep with royalty relief for drilling and production of these deep wells for the purpose of encouraging added deep gas activity. In a 2003 regulation, MMS refined the form of the deep gas drilling incentive to vary by drilling depth and type of well drilled, and also expanded the incentive to include all pre-2001 leases in shallow water that had not previously produced from deep depths. These pre-2001 leases probably contain a significant portion of the deep gas potential as well as substantial in-place infrastructure needed to produce deep gas. For these leases, MMS set a price threshold of about $10.62/MMBtu in 2009 dollars and stipulated a fixed expiration date of May 3, 2009 for starting production from deep wells to earn relief. The intent was to encourage accelerated drilling of this gas source while minimizing the cost of the program. Currently, 54 of these leases qualified for this relief and produced about two percent of all natural gas in the GOM.
The EPAct required MMS to expand deep gas relief to include existing and new leases in 200-400 meters of water and increased the royalty suspension volume for ultra-deep wells at least 20,000 feet subsea by 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas production royalty free beyond the level provided in the MMS-initiated program. MMS issued a regulation in 2007 activating this expanded incentive, along with a price threshold level equal to that used for gas in its current deepwater program. The market prices for natural gas have been above the threshold levels every year since mid-2003, but it appears that this will not be the case in 2009.

Other Royalty Relief: Finally, MMS offers need-based royalty relief on a case-by-case basis under 2 other programs. o End-of-life relief cuts royalty rates in half for producing leases that demonstrate financial loss over the most recent year at existing royalty rates . This program is most important in the Pacific OCS where re-Ieasing of abandoned tracts is not permitted. It was used for about eight fields there in the 1990's, but price threshold provisions relative to market prices have since ended relief for all but one field. This one field uses an older incentive program called net revenue share relief that does not rely on price thresholds. In an effort to provide similar late-stage relief to marginally economic leases in the GOM, EPAct directed MMS to assess the merits of a categorical marginal property royalty relief program. After a careful effort to design and evaluate such a program , 001 issued a formal finding in February 2007 that it is not practical or cost-effective to do so.

o

Special circumstance relief allows leases for which the end-of-life, deep gas or deepwater programs are unavailable or inadequate to seek royalty relief. To do so , the lease must meet certain criteria indicating that relief would fulfill statutory goals for relief, such as promote development, increase production , or encourage production of marginal resources on certain leases. The regulation for this program merely establishes a process for seeking such relief outside the formal royalty relief programs but does not constrain the form or nature of that relief. MMS has evaluated about one special case royalty relief request a year under this authority over the last decade and approved relief in all but one case .

Attachments: Page 213 FY 09 Green Book - OCS Royalty Estimates.pdf Steve, the only relief authority in pre 1996 was end of life relief under OCSLA for which companies could apply and prove that production could not continue without relief. I will check to see if an analysis was every done on pre-1996. The Green Book, page 214 (attached) provides estimates of royalties, including estimates of royalty free production for deep water and deep gas for FY 08 through FY 2013. MMS is working on an analysis of the impact of Kerr McGee. I will check on the timing, but our next update to Sen. Feinstein wasn't expected until the end/first of the year. It would be difficult at best to answer the question ""what the royalties would have been if there wasn't relief. 'MIat criteria would be used? Without the relief some of the projects wouldn't have been explored and/or developed . I will work with our folks tomorrow and will get back with you.

That looks good, Lyn, although any information you can get me before December 20 th would be extremely helpful (such as a summary of the royalty relief categories) . I'd also like to get data on pre-1996 royalty relief, if applicable. I'm not as concerned about the history of royalties paid by company, but I would like to know what the royalties would have been if there wasn 't relief (to answer the big question: what does royalty relief cost us?) . And I'd like the data on amount of royalty-free production (and estimated value of royalties foregone) by year. Thanks, --Steve

Hi Lyn, Now that I'm out from under the hearings, I'm starting to focus on royalty relief again - and I'm realizing that I never put enough time into really understanding all the details of post-2000 royalty relief. Can I get additional details on the number of leases (and the companies that own those leases) that have received royalty relief for leases issued outside 1995-2000? I'd be interested in knowing under what category the suspension volumes fall, the amount of the suspension volume per lease, the amount produced by the lease so far, the amount that has actually been royalty free, the amount of production that has been royalty free this year (or may become royalty free once MMS finalizes the 2009 gas price calculation - and, actually, I could use some clarification here as to when the eligible leases actually get the allowed royalty relief. Is that month-by-month, or do they wait until the end of the year?) due to natural gas prices falling below the price thresholds, and the estimated amount of royalties not paid due to the royalty relief. I'm not sure if I'm making this all entirely clear, but I'm looking for as much information as possible to be able to answer the inevitable questions coming my way. I could certainly discuss this early next week to clarify what I'm looking for in the incredibly likely event that I haven't been entirely clear in the above paragraph. Thanks, --Steve

The purpose ofthis letter is to clarify that NOAA's September 21, 2009, response was intended as a set of infonnal comments, transmitting our initial thoughts regarding the Draft Program. We did not intend for this response to be viewed as a formal set of comments, or for the response to be included as part of the public record. Instead, this response was intended to initiate a dialogue between the agencies on the issues identified, which we think would be the most productive way t6 proceed. r have therefore asked Monica Medina, my Senior Advisor, to contact your office to schedule a meeting to begin that dialogue.

MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE POTENTIAL IMP ACTS OF EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF OCS To INCLUDE THE U.S. TERRITORIES THROUGH CHANGES To THE OCSLA NOVEMBER 2, 2009

Background: The Secretary of the Interior, through the MMS, has the authority to issue leases on the outer Continental Shelf (OCS) of the U.S. for four purposes: 1) to facilitate oil, gas and sulphur exploration and development; 2) to enable renewable energy development; 3) to utilize offshore sand and gravel resources to restore beaches and wetlands; and, 4) to facilitate the exploration and development of U.S. hard mineral resources (e.g., copper, manganese). This authority currently does not extend to the offshore territories and possessions of the U.S. If the OCS Lands Act is amended to extend the OCS and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to the U.S. Territories and possessions, the Secretary's authority to enable leasing of offshore resources would be extended into these areas. The most likely minerals to be explored and developed in the waters off the U.S. territories and possessions would be base metals that occur as massive sulphide deposits in and around seafloor volcanoes, including copper, nickel, gold, silver, and small amounts of other metals. Companies likely to be interested in exploring and developing these deposits would include Nautilus Minerals, Inc., Neptune Minerals, Ltd., Anglo-American, and Teck Cominco, none of which are US corporations. However, Nautilus, Anglo, and Teck all have either a U.S. subsidiary or have operations in the U.S. Due to the geologic and geographic setting, the most likely minerals to be explored and developed in the waters off the U.S. territories and possessions would be base metals that occur as massive sulphide deposits in and around seafloor volcanoes, including copper, nickel, gold, silver, and small amounts of other metals. Companies likely to be interested in exploring and developing these deposits would include Nautilus Minerals, Inc., Neptune Minerals, Ltd., AngloAmerican, and Teck Cominco, none of which are US corporations. However, Nautilus, Anglo, and Teck all have either a U.S. subsidiary or have operations in the U.S. There are two Federal revenue sharing programs under the OeSLA that could be applicable to new leasing activities in Federal waters off the coast ofthe territories and possessions: 1) Section 8(g) of the OCSLA directs the Secretary to share with the affected coastal state 27% of the revenues generated from oil and natural gas leases issued wholly or partially within three nautical miles from the seaward boundary of any coastal state; and 2) Section 8(p)ofthe OCS Lands Act, directs the Secretary to share with the affected coastal state 27% of the revenues generated from renewable energy activities and those activities that support development or transportation of oil or natural gas located wholly or partially within the area extending three nautical miles seaward of the coastal State's submerged lands. There is no revenue sharing authority for oes seabed mineral leasing activity.

Potential Economic Activity o Income and Employment: The per capita income in all of the U.S. territories falls below that of any of the fifty states. An effective and active minerals development plan for the territories would be expected to generate incremental revenue, income and employment in the economically-challenged territories. . Domestic Production of Strategic Minerals: There are a number of strategic minerals that the U.S. imports from abroad. Domestic minerals production would be of strategic value in reducing the U.S. dependence on foreign mineral imports, and could lead to a reduction in the balance of payments to foreign governments by lessening the need for mineral imports. The exact number and extent of strategic minerals is not well known. It is also unknown how difficult it will be to mine these minerals offshore, particularly in areas far removed from traditional mining infrastructures, and in the very deep waters that surround most of the islands Minerals development is inherently financially risky, more so offshore. Mineral prices are volatile and the number of companies involved in offshore mining is small. The success of the program depends on the future prices of minerals and the financial viability of mining companies (and their ability to obtain financing). o Economic Diversification: Most of the territories are heavily dependent on only one or two key industries. Should offshore minerals mining become a significant industry, this could help to diversify the territorial economies. Renewable Energy Potential: The technologies which MMS is pursuing with respect to renewables, particularly wind technology, could be applied equally to the territories. Enable Sand and Gravel Program (where appropriate): Given that some territories are heavily dependent on tourism, the ability to maintain and replenish their beaches could be potentially valuable to some U.S. territories, particularly those in the Caribbean. Potential Resource Use Conflicts: There is the potential for conflict with other users of the open seas including fishing, shipping, aquaCUlture, renewable energy development, etc.

o

o

o

o

Increased Scientific Research and Incentive for Improved Technology o Increased Knowledge of Resource Base: Exploration would provide the government new data which would increase its knowledge as to what resources are available within the territories and also how to best develop these resources. There is a possibility, of course, that such exploration would determine that the resources are less than expected and not viable for economic exploitation.

Page 2 of3

o

Improved Environmental Knowledge: All of the processes and procedures used by MMS (NEP A, EIS, etc.) to evaluate the environmental impacts of any proposed development would apply to the territories. New research would be undertaken to better understand the natural environments within the offshore territories. The assessments could also determine that the habitats are too fragile for the proposed resource extraction activities. Improved Technology: Active interest in the new areas would expand knowledge of seabed mineral deposits where little or no exploration has previously occurred, which creates a ripple effect of helping to find deposits in other deep seabed areas. Also this would help advance technologies for both exploration and development of minerals in the deep ocean floors, particularly for U.S. companies.

o

Revenues
o Increased Federal Revenues: If mineral leasing were to take place in the territories, the Federal government would obtain royalties, rents and bonus bids on minerals leased in the territories, all of which would be new income sources. Increased Territorial Revenues: Under current provisions, the territories with submerged lands could obtain revenues from renewable energy projects leased within three miles of the boundary of their submerged lands and see employment benefits from development activities if the areas are ultimately leased and developed.

o

Administrative
o DOIIMMS has Relevant Experience: MMS largely has the requisite regulations and procedures in place, as well as personnel that are qualified to manage this process. No Agency has Current Responsibility: There is currently no Federal agency that has responsibility for overseeing minerals development offshore of the U.S. territories. These resources cannot be evaluated, let alone developed, until some agency is given authority to manage the federal resources. Potential Administrative Conflict with Territories or with other Federal Agencies: Although the Office oflnsular Affairs (OIA), NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service all have some administrative role in managing territorial resources) The Secretary's current leasing authority, if the OCS Lands Act is extended to include the territories and possessions, would most likely apply only outside the limits of the territories' control and to areas not under the specific jurisdiction of any wildlife refuge, marine sanctuary or marine monument. The extent to which individual jurisdictions would be supportive of the construction of land-based storage or forwarding facilities is not known at this time and may vary among the jurisdictions.

o

o

lOlA provides technical and financial assistance to the territorial resource management agencies, but has no management authority with one exception. For the moment, OIA has default administrative responsibility for the waters off CNMI until Congress enacts legislation granting CNMI jurisdiction over its territorial waters consistent with the other 4 self-governing U.S. territories.

362818-mms5-pdf-70-188-189,"Renewable Energy Uses of the Outer Continental Shelf MMS Massachusetts Task Force Charter
DRAFT, October 14, 2009

Introduction
On April 22, 2009, President Barack Obama announced that the Minerals Management Service (MMS) finalized the framework for renewable energy generation on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The framework establishes a MMS program to issue leases, easements, and rights-ofway for orderly, safe, and environmentally responsible renewable energy development activities, such as the siting and construction of wind generation facilities on the OCS. The MMS is planning to consider a commercial leasing process offshore the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This charter establishes a Massachusetts Federal-state-Iocal-tribal government task force to assist government decision-making regarding renewable energy leasing and development on the OCS off the coast of Massachusetts.

Authority
Subsection 8(p)(7) of the OCS Lands Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of2005 (EPAct), directs the MMS to coordinate and consult with the Governor of any state or the executive of any local government that may be affected by a renewable energy lease, easement, or right-of-way on the OCS. The MMS is establishing the MMS Massachusetts Task Force to help fulfill this obligation in its consideration of potential leasing activities on the OCS offshore Massachusetts.

Purpose
The MMS Massachusetts Task Force is chartered by the MMS Associate Director for Offshore Energy and Minerals Management (OEMM) to facilitate coordination and consultation on commercial leasing proposals on the OCS offshore Massachusetts as stipulated in EPAct 2005. This Task Force is not chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Numerous local, state, and federal governmental agencies have statutory roles related to OCS renewable energy projects. To the extent practicable, the task force will work to ensure the most efficient and effective review of proposed projects to support the Administration's goal of broadening the energy resource portfolio for the Nation and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's goal of meeting its Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and developing renewable energy resources off its coast. Immediate Charge - to be presented at the first MMS Massachusetts Task Force meeting in November 2009: o Review and adopt charter;

o Explain the MMS leasing processes for OCS renewable energy and discuss in detail the specific steps proposed for leasing off Massachusetts, beginning with a planned Request for Interest as the first step; o Detail specific actions or categories of actions required by both the MMS and the state to support Massachusetts' s stated goal of developing offshore renewable energy, and the associated timeframe with each; o Identify additional appropriate Federal, tribal, and/or state/local government representatives/points of contact to serve as initial participants on the task force; o Adopt operating and communication procedures for the task force; and o Identify additional topics that need to be addressed by the task force.

Subsequent Activities - to be considered by the MMS Massachusetts Task Force in future meetings, possibly to include the following: o Summarize present status, immediate future, and long-range timeframe regarding proposed projects; o Develop process for communicating and streamlining the permit and review process for proposed projects; o Identify any regulatory uncertainties that may become issues of concern during the review of proposed projects; and o Identify data gaps that require further study.

Membership
Members of the MMS Massachusetts Task Force include Federal agencies, tribal governments, and Massachusetts State and local agencies that have a role in permitting, reviewing, and/or regulating resources or activities that could be affected by or have an effect on renewable energy development on the OCS. The MMS recognizes that the participants in the task force may change over time as the status of project review progresses, and that the membership list will not be static. The Governor has designated Secretary Ian A. Bowles ofthe Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) to act on the Governor's behalf on the Task Force to lead efforts on behalf of state and local agencies. The MMS will also work with tribal and Federal agencies to identify a primary point of contact for each distinct government body represented. These primary points of contact will be responsible for rallying participation from all possible participating functional units within their respective organizations and cultivating open exchange of information throughout the process.

Initial Schedule
o November 19,2009 - Convene the first Massachusetts Task Force meeting to introduce the task force and discuss the draft charter. The meeting location is below: Massachusetts Maritime Academy 101 Academy Drive, Buzzards Bay, MA 02532 Phone: (508) 530-5000

John, MMS is scheduled to briefing Rep. Delahunt on the status efforts to establish an OCS renewable energy Task Force with Massachusetts on Thursday, Nov. 5, at 12:30 pm. We look forward to the meeting. In the meantime, I wanted to provide you with some information on our efforts to establish the task force. The MMS offshore renewable energy program is involved with many collaborative efforts, actively coordinating with other agencies, states, localities, tribes, and other stakeholders. The mandate of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 explicitly requires coordination with affected state and local governments. To meet this requirement, MMS is coordinating task forces with state, local and tribal leaders in states seeking offshore renewable energy development. MMS has proactively embraced such Federal/State coordination with the scheduling of the first meetings oftask forces in Delaware, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island by the end of November, with other states, including Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina, expected shortly thereafter. MMS has been working closely with the Governor-appointed points of contact within the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) to plan the first task force meeting, which has been recently scheduled for November 19, in Buzzards Bay. The first invitation letters have been sent to the appropriate Federal officials, the Chairwoman of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) and the Tribal Chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Trib, and to the Chairs of Board of Selectmen of the Towns of Westport, Dartmouth, Aquinnah, Chilmark, Gosnold, Tisbury, Nantucket, Edgartown, and the Martha's Vineyard Commission and the Nantucket Planning Board .. Among the Federal invitees are the following: NOAA, Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, FAA, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau ofIndian Affairs, Navy, and EPA. The attached Draft Charter was provided with the invitation letters. The draft charter outlines the purpose of the task force, planned tasks, and information on its membership. The agenda for the first task force meeting is to identify additional individuals that should be invited to join the Task Force and to begin the process of discussing and finalizing a Task Force Charter. Please keep in mind this is only a first draft and is expected to change somewhat based on discussions and deliberations ofthe Task Force.

Hi Lyn, Now that I'm out from under the hearings, I'm starting to focus on royalty relief again - and I'm realizing that I never put enough time into really understanding all the details of post-2000 royalty relief. Can I get additional details on the number of leases (and the companies that own those leases) that have received royalty relief for leases issued outside 1995-2000? I'd be interested in knowing under what category the suspension volumes fall, the amount of the suspension volume per lease, the amount produced by the lease so far, the amount that has actually been royalty free, the amount of production that has been royalty free this year (or may become royalty free once MMS finalizes the 2009 gas price calculation - and, actually, I could use some clarification here as to when the eligible leases actually get the allowed royalty relief. Is that month-by-month, or do they wait until the end of the year?) due to natural gas prices falling below the price thresholds, and the estimated amount of royalties not paid due to the royalty relief. I'm not sure if I'm making this all entirely clear, but I'm looking for as much information as possible to be able to answer the inevitable questions coming my way. I could certainly discuss this early next week to clarify what I'm looking for in the incredibly likely event that I haven't been entirely clear in the above paragraph. Thanks, --Steve

Steve, There have been 51 blocks on 50 leases (2 of the 51 blocks are included in a unit) which have earned a royalty suspension volume (RSV) and used that RSV on production from 68 qualified wells. The magnitude of that production was 303 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas. The data are through June, 2009. In addition, there were 15 leases which earned a royalty suspension supplement (RSS) for drilling an eligible dry hole. Six of these leases did not use any of the RSS that was earned. Four of these six have expired . The other nine leases were able to apply 21 bcf equivalent of the earned RSS to other gas or oil production on the lease or unit. None of the eligible wells or leases were in 200-400 meters of water depth, and none were associated with a qualified well drilled deeper than 20,000 feet subsea after 2005, i.e., none were related to the EPAct provisions.

Subject: RE: Various Green Book Questions (+ 2 others)
Steve, MMS is working to respond to all your Green Book questions, and question #13. Below is information in response to your question regarding the 2006 UERR spreadsheets. I will be out of the office tomorrow through next week. Please let Anita and Lesley know if you need assistance.

12. In the 2006 UERR spreadsheets, MMS states that gas prices are tied to oil prices, so the individual values are not independent. It appears that they are not as well tied as previously believed. Does this affect the 2006 UERR calculations at all, or is it possible to just take the Total Liquid values corresponding to a particular oil price and the Total Gas values corresponding to a particular gas price and combine them to calculate a new BOE? Are there other places where MMS does analysis based on an assumption of linked oil & gas prices, and will those be revisited?

Estimates of UERR are generated at discrete oil/gas price pairs. For the 2006 Assessment these oil/gas pairs were $46/bbl and $6.96/Mcf, $60/bbl and $9.07IMcf, and $80/bbl and $12.10IMcf respectively. They are based on mean resource values and the oil/gas price pairs are not independent of each other; that is, one specific oil price cannot be used to obtain an oil resource estimate and a separate gas price used to obtain a gas resource estimate. The gas price is dependent on the oil price and must be used in conjunction with the oil price to calculate resources. The reason for this condition is that oil and gas frequently occur together and the individual pool economics are calculated using the coupled pricing. MMS realizes that this tie between oil and gas prices varies significantly over a range of prices. To adjust for the phenomenon where high oil prices do not necessarily equate to parallel increases in gas prices, we have re-visited our Economic Resource Assessment Model to now include the ability to vary this oil-togas price relationship across a wide selection of prices. This new feature will be part of our next National Assessment.

The National Assessment is the only place where MMS reports DERR's at discrete price pairs for the purpose of generating price supply curves. Our fair market value analysis used oil and gas price pairs but samples though a range of price pairings that are actually observed at a point in time that is close to the date of the lease sale.

Hi Lyn,

I didn't quite get through the Green Book as quickly as I wanted ,to , but now that FY10 has started , I figured I should send you those questions that I have and get ready for FY11 . I have 11 questions that relate directly to issues in the Green Book, and then two other additional questions that don't directly relate to the budget. Let me know if I need to clarify any of these . Thanks, --Steve

FY10 MMS Green Book Questions 1. Why were cost recovery fees split out from offsetting receipts in 2009, but are lumped back into offsetting receipts in 2010 (as they were in years before 2009)? 2. Why isn't the ESP a separate subactivity? It seems that the functions of the ESP are distinct from the rest ofLE, and the advantages that MMS claims will be gained by a new renewable energy subactivity would also be gained by a separate ESP subactivity. 3. The amount of money brought in per dollar spent on compliance has gone up significantly since the FY09 Green Book it's $8.55 for each dollar spent on audits from FY06 to FY08, whereas from FY04 through FY06 it was $5.01 for each dollar spent on compliance reviews and $3.56 for each dollar spent on audits. What is the breakdown for compliance reviews vs. audits for the FY06 - FY08 time period? And what is the reason for the considerable increase? 4. What is an ""operator performance audit""? [Mentioned on page 13-14 under ""Current 5-year Program""] 5. The budget proposes a decrease in ""Implement OIG Compliance and Audit Recommendations"" of $1 .156 million, although that initiative had a request of $2 million in the FY09 budget (with 4 FTEs). Is it correct to assume that the large ""ongoing operations"" costs ($844,000) primarily cover the 4 FTEs that would still be on staff? 6. The decrease in ""Improve Automated Interest Billing to Companies"" is $1.36 million, while the FY09 request for that initiative was $1 .7 million with zero FTEs. Does that mean this initiative requires $340,000 in continuing operations costs, and what exactly are those costs? 7. Of the 7.08:1 ratio for compliance activities (or 5.08:1 ratio without Burlington), how does that break down for audits vs . compliance reviews? That is, what are the cost benefit ratios separately for audits and compliance reviews? 8. Could you explain a little more about the fact that contractor assistance will now be needed to prepare the 5-year plan EIS? What does it mean that ""MMS must now use funds intended for other important oil and gas programs to acquire contractor assistance in preparing the document""? What ""other important programs""? [po65) 9. The budget assumes $1.5 billion over ten years due to royalty reforms and rate adjustments (p. 189) - how did MMS come up with that number? 10. In Table 42 (p. 200), the onshore rents and bonuses from coal leasing is projected to soar in FY11, going from $274 million in FY10 to $700M in FY11. In last year's projections, there were huge jumps anticipated in FY09 and FY10 (with $1.3 and $2.3 billion in rents and bonuses, respectively). Can I get a little more information on where these estimates are coming from , and why there's a huge jump expected starting in FY11? 11. In Table 46 (p. 204), the amount of on-shore natural gas production is estimated to increase slightly from 3.09 tcf in FY09 to 3.28 tcf in FY12, then go back down to 3.07 tcf by FY14. Last year's table had natural gas production increasing steadily to 3.808 tcf in FY13. What's the reason for the difference between last year's and this year's estimates? Non-Green-Book questions 12. In the 2006 UERR spreadsheets, MMS states that gas prices are tied to oil prices, so the individual values are not independent. It appears that they are not as well tied as previously believed. Does this affect the 2006 UERR calculations at all , or is it possible to just take the Total Liquid values corresponding to a particular oil price and the Total Gas values corresponding to a particular gas price and combine them to calculate a new BOE? Are there other places where MMS does analysis based on an assumption of linked oil & gas prices, and will those be revisited? 13. Does MMS or 001 keep track of production volumes of various non-conventional gas sources? That is, do we have a breakdown of how much gas on federal lands came from shales, how much from CBM , etc.?

Hi Lyn,

I didn't quite get through the Green Book as quickly as I wanted to, but now that FY10 has started, I figured I should send you those questions that I have and get ready for FY11. I have 11 questions that relate directly to issues in the Green Book, and then two other additional questions that don't directly relate to the budget. Let me know if I need to clarify any of these.
Thanks,

FY10 MMS Green Book Questions

1. Why were cost recovery fees split out from offsetting receipts in 2009, but are lumped back into offsetting receipts in 2010 (as they were in years before 2009)?
Answer: Offsetting collections are composed of certain oes rental receipts and cost recovery fees that MMS is authorized to retain. The FY 2010 budget contained a proposal for a new inspection fee for oes facilities that would be retained by MMS. Each of these -- retained rental receipts, cost recovery fees, and the new inspection fee -- are offsetting receipts and the level of display detail is determined in consultation with OMB. The level of offsetting rental receipts and cost recovery fees are driven by external economic factors and industry activities. In the FY 2010 budget, rental receipts and cost recovery fees were presented together to provide a succinct presentation of the bureau' s budget request and highlight the new inspection fee.

2. Why isn't the ESP a separate subactivity? It seems that the functions of the ESP are distinct from the rest of LE, and the advantages that MMS claims will be gained by a new renewable energy subactivity would also be gained by a separate ESP subactivity.

Page 2 of5

Answer: Funding for the Environmental Studies Program (ESP) is a subset of the Leasing and Environmental Assessment Subactivity. ESP is intimately related to preparation and execution of the Five-Year Oil and Gas Program, as the information acquired by these studies is used to support management decisions for the oil and gas program, and now the Renewable Energy program. Environmental Studies for the sand and gravel program represent only $500,000 in dedicated funding, and while the Renewable Energy program is growing, most ESP funds do support the oil and gas program. Also, by residing in the LEA Subactivity, if additional funds are needed for NEP A compliance work to support the execution of a new five-year program, MMS could do so quickly within existing reprogramming guidelines. It should be noted that this capability will be especially important as the administration makes decisions on the direction of the new five-year program. Depending upon the outcome of these decisions, planning areas previously under moratoria may be newly available, requiring additional environmental studies and analysis. At this time MMS believes that funding for this program should remain in the Leasing and Environmental Subactivity. 3. The amount of money brought in per dollar spent on compliance has gone up significantly since the FY09 Green Book - it's $S.55 for each dollar spent on audits from FY06 to FYOS, whereas from FY04 through FY06 it was $5.01 for each dollar spent on compliance reviews and $3.56 for each dollar spent on audits. What is the breakdown for compliance reviews vs. audits for the FY06 - FYOS time period? And what is the reason for the considerable increase? Answer: The benefit-cost ratio breakdown for FY 2006 - FY 2008 is Compliance Reviews $4.44: 1 and Audits $8.55:1. The dramatic increase in the benefit-cost ratio for audits and the overall program increase is due to the Burlington settlement ($105,300,000 during FY 2007). Without this settlement the audit benefit-cost ratio is $4.76:1. 4. What is an ""operator performance audit""? [Mentioned on page 13-14 under ""Current 5-year Program""] Answer: MMS conducts several types of ""audits"" related to operator performance. MMS performs an annual performance review on every operator. This review begins with an MMS analysis of the results of the operator's inspections comparing non-compliance actions issued by MMS to the complexity of their operations as evidenced by the number of equipment components operating during the course of the year. This statistical analysis is the first filter for determining if the company will be called in to the region or district for face-to-face meetings, and if the company is performing at acceptable levels and does not need to meet with MMS. Both of these actions constitute an annual operator performance reVIew. MMS may also require operators that demonstrate an incomplete knowledge of the regulations during an inspection to come in for a perfonnance review. And finally, any operator that has had a history of accidents or near-miss events may also be subject to a perfonnance review with MMS. This program has been active for the past twelve years and has been very successful in redirecting poorer perfonners into the acceptable realm. Additionally, under anticipate regulatory changes in the recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Safety Management Systems, MMS is planning to conduct audits of any company's safety management system that has had compliance problems or significant and/or chronic accidents. This audit will examine several elements relating to the management of an operation such as mechanical integrity; operational procedures; management of change; and hazards analysis. MMS has determined that these four elements contribute to over 90% of the accidents occurring on the oes. These audits are labor and time intensive and require a systems approach to understanding and ensuring safety management.

Finally, MMS conducts accident investigation audits of serious events occurring on a facility, such as a fatality, a serious injury, or a major fire. These audits require onsite investigations and interviews of the company workforce to determine the sequence of events that led to the accident. Information derived from accident investigation audits is extremely valuable and often results in MMS-issued Safety Alerts or even changes to regulations. 5. The budget proposes a decrease in ""Implement OIG Compliance and Audit Recommendations"" of $1.156 million, although that initiative had a request of $2 million in the FY09 budget (with 4 FTEs). Is it correct to assume that the large ""ongoing operations"" costs ($844,000) primarily cover the 4 FTEs that would still be on staff? Answer: The $844,000 represents ongoing full-year funding of $568,000 for 4 FTE, plus $276,000 for ongoing systems operations costs. Generally, MRM estimates continuing support at approximately 20% of the initial investment. As IT system functionality is expanded and significant enhancements are made to the MRMSS, in addition to the initial investment, there are often increased ongoing operations and support costs for the overall system. These costs include patches for ongoing updates, additional contract labor, code modifications when new releases of the underlying software are incorporated, ongoing security patches, mandated system changes from outside sources, and minor software adjustments to support and increase efficiency as platforms and inter-related software changes. 6. The decrease in ""Improve Automated Interest Billing to Companies"" is $1.36 million, while the FY09 request for that initiative was $1.7 million with zero FTEs. Does that mean this initiative requires $340,000 in continuing operations costs, and what exactly are those costs? Answer: Yes there are ongoing operations costs. Please see the response to question 5. 7. Of the 7.08:1 ratio for compliance activities (or 5.08:1 ratio without Burlington), how does that break down for audits vs. compliance reviews? That is, what are the cost:benefit ratios separately for audits and compliance reviews? Answer: The benefit-cost ratio for FY 2005-2007, excluding the FY 2007 Burlington settlement, is $5.49: 1 for compliance reviews and $4.71: 1 for audits. 8. Could you explain a little more about the fact that contractor assistance will now be needed to prepare the 5-year plan EIS? What does it mean that ""MMS must now use funds intended for other important oil and gas programs to acquire contractor assistance in preparing the document""? What ""other important programs""? [po 65] Answer: Development of the FY 2010 budget began at a time when MMS was accelerating development of a new Five-Year Program at the direction of the previous administration. At that time, MMS anticipated it would need to begin scoping meetings, public hearings, and environmental work in 2009 and into 2010 to prepare for a new 2010-2015 Five-Year Program. In order to do so, redirection of funding from other program areas was being considered to fund this effort, the most likely candidates being other activities funded in the Leasing and Environmental Subactivity, such as studies and assessments. The delay in key decisions related to the Five-Year Program to FY 2010 relieved the pressure of redirecting funds, and with the likely passage of the FY 2010 request, MMS anticipates it will not need to redirect any funding from other program areas.

Page 4 of 5

The use of contractor assistance in preparing the draft EIS has increased over the two past cycles as the availability of in-house resources for this task has declined, and the scope, complexity, and level of detail required has increased. Preparation for the next EIS will certainly require a greater level of effort, based on the number of public meetings held and the number of comments already submitted on the Notice of Intent. It should be noted that whenever contractor assistance is used, those documents (and/or sections) received are considered as purely draft input in to a future, final product. MMS must, and is expected to, further revise, adjust, and expand these submissions as necessary, making them our own in their entirety. 9. The budget assumes $1.5 billion over ten years due to royalty reforms and rate adjustments (p. 189) - how did MMS come up with that number? As stated in the Green Book on page ?189 and by Secretary Salazar at the Committee's hearing on September 16, the Department anticipates implementing appropriate royalty rate adjustments once a review is complete. While no decision has been made on a royalty rate adjustment, the Budget estimates are based on estimated future production times a range of potential increases in royalty rates 10. In Table 42 (p. 200), the onshore rents and bonuses from coal leasing is projected to soar in FY11, going from $274 million in FY10 to $700M in FY11.ln last year's projections, there were huge jumps anticipated in FY09 and FY10 (with $1.3 and $2.3 billion in rents and bonuses, respectively). Can I get a little more information on where these estimates are coming from, and why there's a huge jump expected starting in FY11? Answer: There is uncertainty in the projected sale dates. BLM has used a conservative set of assumptions for projecting sale dates. However, there remain many sources of uncertainty when projecting a coal lease sale date which can include: o o o o o o o many agencies and entities need to interact to complete processing of a coal lease application to the point of a lease sale; applicants may request a processing delay; coal lease sales could happen, but the BLM does not receive any bids that are at least equal to the presale estimate of fair market value; a shortage of resources necessary for processing applications; changes in general market for coal or economic conditions; issues that arise as a part of public participation in an Environmental Impact Statement; and other issues may arise or change over the lengthy processing time.

BLM is currently processing 34 coal lease applications that are located in 8 states. The projected revenues for coal lease sales will increase between FY2010 and FY2011 because BLM anticipates several very large lease applications in Wyoming to mature to the point of a coal lease sale during FY2011. While the projections show that 11 leases would be sold in FY201 0 containing 1.3 billion tons, BLM expects the sale of 10 leases in FY20 11 containing a total of 2.4 billion tons. In addition, approximately 286 million tons of the additional 1.1 billions tons for FY2011 are from Wyoming with much higher anticipated bonus bids. Therefore, the variance between FY201 0 and FY20 11 is due to leasing larger tracts of coal that have a higher relative value. 11. In Table 46 (p. 204), the amount of on-shore natural gas production is estimated to increase slightly from 3.09 tcf in FY09 to 3.28 tcf in FY12, then go back down to 3.07 tcf

by FY14. Last year's table had natural gas production increasing steadily to 3.808 tcf in FY13. What's the reason for the difference between last year's and this year's estimates?

Answer: BLM estimates onshore natural gas production. Last year's estimates were based on the number of applications for permit to drill (APDs) from historical trend. Since then, there has been a significant decline in the number of APDs that were incorporated in FY 2010's estimates. Hence, the latest estimate is based on a lower number of natural gas wells being drilled and put into production. With the decline in production from existing wells, by FY 2014 the amount of replacement production will be less than the decline in production.

Non-Green-Book questions 12. In the 2006 UERR spreadsheets, MMS states that gas prices are tied to oil prices, so the individual values are not independent. It appears that they are not as well tied as previously believed . Does this affect the 2006 UERR calculations at all, or is it possible to just take the Total Liquid values corresponding to a particular oil price and the Total Gas values corresponding to a particular gas price and combine them to calculate a new BOE? Are there other places where MMS does analysis based on an assumption of linked oil & gas prices, and wililhose be revisited?

13. Does MMS or 001 keep track of production volumes of various non-conventional gas sources? That is, do we have a breakdown of how much gas on federal lands came from shales, how much from CBM, etc.?

Subject: RE: Citation Waste Water

Stratton, in response to your question and reference to the Virginia Sierra Club posting, I am providing a summary of the MMS' s environmental studies on the fates and effects of drilling discharges in the marine environment, and a few summary bullets and a link to a National Academy of Science report, ""Drilling Discharges in the Marine Environment"". If you have further questions, please let us know. MMS studies: Since the inception of the Environmental Studies Program, MMS and its predecessor agencies have recognized the importance of understanding the fates and effects of drilling discharges in the marine environment. The MMS has funded numerous workshops, literature syntheses, and studies that address the environmental effects of drilling discharges in offshore environments. Key concerns include the fate of the discharges in the environment including dispersion, degradation, and deposition resulting in smothering and alteration of the benthic environment. Acute and chronic toxic effects on biota both in the water column and at the seafloor are also a concern. Drilling discharges are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through the permitting process, but it is the responsibility of MMS to assess the impacts to the environment and ensure they are minimized. The MMS has worked closely with the EPA to share impact information. In 1993, the EPA finalized guidelines for the discharge of drilling fluids. In general, the results from the years of study indicate that the observable effects are limited to radial distance of 100 to 1000 meters from the discharge point, with the area being greater in deep waters. Little evidence suggests that there are acute responses to drilling discharges assuming that mitigation measures are employed. The primary mitigation measures include prohibition of the discharge of muds and cuttings containing oil-based fluids and synthetic-based fluids; limits on the concentration of SBF on discharged cuttings; and the dispersion of water-based muds and cuttings unless the discharge radius is in close proximity to a sensitive biological community. Here follows a few summary bullets of the National Academy of Science report, ""Drilling Discharges in the Marine Environment"" (1983); the report can be found at the following link:
1. Drilling mud and cuttings discharges are closely regulated by EPA under the National Pollutant

Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program. This program prohibits discharge practices and components that could have negative environmental impacts. 2. The volume of muds and cuttings discharged varies considerably depending on the well depth, geology, formation pressures, processing equipment, and other factors. Discharge volumes range from virtually zero (for some development projects with grinders and disposal wells) to 6000 bbls for some deep exploratory wells. In all cases, solids control equipment is used to reduce discharge volumes and muds are reused to the extent practicable. 3. In addition to water, the primary mud components - clay and barite - have very low toxicity. All components must be approved by EPA. Specific toxicity analyses are required as part of that review. In areas where the smothering of benthic organisms may be of concern, such as shallow bays and estuaries, EPA prohibits discharges and mUds/cuttings must be disposed at onshore sites.

4.

Drilling fluid components and discharges were meticulously monitored during the drilling of 8 exploratory wells in the North Atlantic (Danenberger, 1983, Georges Bank Exploratory Drilling). Barite (barium sulfate) use varied from 812,000 pounds to 2.8 million tons per well. Bentonite (clay) use varied from 497,000 to 1.2 million pounds per well. All other components were used in much lower quantities. Dr. Mike Bothner, USGS - Woods Hole, analyzed sediment samples at 2 of the well sites and at regional control stations. While barium (from barite) concentrations increased by factors up to 3.5 at the well sites, the post-drilling concentrations at other locations on Georges Bank were within the range of pre-drilling concentrations. No other changes in sediment chemistry were observed.

362811-mms5-pdf-63-168-172,"Minerals Management Service Coastal Impact Assistance Program Eligibility Requirements for Subgrants and Sub grantees

Section 384 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the Coastallmpact Assistance Program (ClAP) and provides that eligible recipients are limited to States and Coastal Political subdivisions (CPS's). The relevant Federal regulations that apply to ClAP grant awards are those available at 43 CFR Part 12, Subpart C, ""Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments"" (hereinafter ""Subpart C""). A ClAP grantee (recipient) may award a ""sub grant"" to an eligible ""subgrantee,"" however the subgrantee must satisfy certain definitions and requirements under Subpart C to be eligible for ClAP funds. To help expedite the award of ClAP grants to recipients and clarify the relevant administrative requirements under 43 CFR Part 12, Subpart C, (found at http://vlex.comlsource/l092/page/3), the Minerals Management Service (MMS) has developed the following guidance.

1. What type of organization qualifies as an eligible ClAP subgrantee?

An eligible ClAP sub grantee is a State or local governmental agency or organization or other similar legal entity to which a sub grant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use of the funds provided.

2. What are the relevant definitions that help determine whether an organization qualifies as an eligible ClAP subgrantee?
The following relevant definitions contained within 43 CFR 12.43 help determine whether an organization is an eligible ClAP subgrantee:
Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group of community (including any Native village as defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims settlement Act, 85 Stat 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the special programs and services provided by him through the bureau of Indian Affairs. Government means a State or local government or a federally recognized Indian tribal government. Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award document.

Page 1 of 5

Local government means a county, municipality, city township, local public authority, (including any public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 1973), school district, special district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under State law), any other regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or instrumentality of a local government. State means any of the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any public and Indian housing agency under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Sub grant means the government or other legal entity to which a sub grant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use of the funds.

3. The definitions of State and Local government both include the term ""instrumentality."" What is an instrumentality of a State or local government and how does it determine the eligibility of a ClAP subgrantee?
Generally, an instrumentality of a government that qualifies as an eligible ClAP sub grantee is an organization that: 1. is used for a governmental purpose and performs a governmental function; 2. performs functions on behalf of a State or local government; and 3. is organized, controlled, and supervised by a public authority or authorities. An organization that satisfies the above three criteria can be classified as an instrumentality of a government, and would qualify as an eligible ClAP sub grantee. The MMS will determine whether above criteria are met based upon aU relevant information provided by the recipient.

4. An eligible ClAP subgrantee can be an ""other legal entity,"" as the definition of subgrantee under 43 CFR 12.43 indicates, however, what type of organization can be classified as an ""other legal entity""?
In the context of Subpart C, which pertains to ClAP grants to State and local governments, the term other legal entity means the following: 1. the legal entity was organized and/ or created by a State or local government, including a governmental organization or agency, and 2. such entity maintains some type of existing legal relationship with the State, local government, or relevant governmental organization or agency.

Page 2 of 5

Even if the governmental organization is not one listed in the relevant definitions of State and local government at 43 CFR 12.43, it may still be classified as an instrumentality of a State or local government and qualify as an eligible ClAP subgrantee.

5. Does a private non-profit organization that was not formed or organized by a State or local government, such as a private land trust, qualify as an eligible ClAP subgrantee?
No. The relevant Federal regulations pertaining to ClAP grants, subgrants, and cooperative agreements with States and local governments, including CPS's, limits sub grants to those subgrantees that meet the definitions of State and local government, which includes any agency or instrumentality of a State or local government. 43 CFR 12.43.

6. Are public universities eligible ClAP subgrantees?
43 CFR Part 12, Subpart C, governs ClAP grants and subgrants to State and local governments. Subpart C does not classify a State or local institution of higher education as an organization that meets the relevant definitions of State and local governments. Specifically, recipients may award grants and subgrants to State and local governments, however, ""State and local institutions of higher education"" are not classified as ""governments"" and are therefore ineligible subgrantees under 43 CFR Part 12 Subpart C. 43 CFR ?? 12.44(a)(1). In spite of these regulatory limitations on subgrants to public universities, ClAP recipients may enter into contractual arrangements with public universities as long as relevant requirements are met, as described below. In order for a recipient to issue a contract instead of a subgrant, all requirements stated in 43 CFR Part 12.76 ""Procurement"" must be met. This part of the CFR addresses requirements for procuring goods and services, including competition standards. Accordingly, State governments must fulfill their own State laws and regulations for procurements, while CPS's must meet the procurement requirements stated in 43 CFR 12.76(b)-(i). When applying for funds that include subcontracts, recipients should describe how they met relevant procurement requirements with an emphasis on explaining the methods used to obtain adequate competition.

7. If a proposed subgrantee does not qualify as an eligible ClAP subgrantee, what can recipients do to achieve the purposes of the ClAP grant?
Recipients may award procurement contracts and subcontracts to fulfill the purposes of the project. Under 43 CFR Part 12, Subpart C, a ""contract"" includes a ""procurement contract under a grant"" and ""a procurement subcontract under a contract."" 43 CFR 12.43. States that procure services under a ClAP grant award are required to follow their own relevant State and local laws and procedures, as described under 43 CFR 12.76(a). The CPS's must follow the relevant Federal procurement requirements under 43 CFR 12.76(b)-(i) which provide a Page 3 of 5

detailed explanation for proper award of procurement contracts. This includes, but is not limited to, procurement standards; achieving adequate competition; methods of procurement; contracting with small and minority firms; contract cost and price analysis; bonding requirements; and required contract provisions. Recipients are ultimately responsible for complying with all applicable procurement requirements. However, the Grant Officer assigned to the individual grant application will work with the recipient to help determine whether procurement requirements have been met.

8. ' Are there any restrictions for transferring title to real property purchased with ClAP funds?
Yes. Recipients may subgrant the real property, or estimated/approved ClAP funds, to an eligible sub grantee. Namely, those organizations that are listed in the relevant definitions of State and local government under 43 CFR 12.43, including agencies and instrumentalities of such governments, as explained in Question #3 above. When awarding and administering a CIAP subgrant, States and CPS's must follow the relevant requirements for subgrants under 43 CFR 12.77. Recipients may also hold title to the property themselves and/or enter into contractual agreements or contracts with non-eligible subgrantees, including a maintenance agreement or conservation easement. Under either of these agreements, the State or local government, as a recipient of ClAP funds, would hold fee simple title to the property, while the non-eligible sub grantee enters into an agreement with the recipient to help manage and conserve the property using a procurement contract. Expenses associated with managing the property, such as those pertaining to operation and maintenance may be added to the project and awarded from MMS to the recipient only for the period of the grant award. States that procure property under a ClAP grant award are required to follow relevant State and local laws and procedures, as described under 43 CFR 12.76(a). The CPS's must follow the relevant Federal procurement requirements under 43 CFR 12.76(b)-(i).

9. How do recipients demonstrate that the proposed subgrantee is an eligible ClAP subgrantee?
To qualify as an eligible ClAP subgrantee, the recipient must demonstrate within the State Plan project description and/or the grant application Project Narrative Attachment that the legal entity satisfactorily meets the three criteria for determining whether an organization is an instrumentality of a State or local government. These criteria are listed under Question #3 above.

Page 4 of5

10. If a current grant application proposes to subgrant ClAP funds to an ineligible subgrantee or transfer title to real property purchased with ClAP funds to an ineligible subgrantee, what are the next steps?
Once there is a determination that a grant application contains an ineligible ClAP subgrantee"" the assigned Grant Officer will notify the point-of-contact, as stated on the SF-424 application form, on the next appropriate steps. Any changes to the grant application must also be made to the project description in the recipient's approved ClAP State Plan. These changes, however, will not constitute an Amendment to the Plan.

11. If a project in an approved State Plan contains an ineligible subgrantee, what are the next steps?
Recipients may either: 1. submit the relevant grant application with the appropriate changes to the subgrantee, or 2. submit the changes in the State Plan for review and approval.

To all Coastal Impact Assistance Recipients In light of questions that have arisen on Coastal Impact Assistance Program (ClAP) applications with proposed subgrant action, we requested legal review and guidance. The guidance is specific to applications with proposed subgrants and the relevant Federal regulations pertaining to grants with State and local governments under 43 CFR Part 12 Subpart C.

Jon, ""Any infrastructure constructed entirely above mean high water (MHW) will be considered as onshore infrastructure. Any infrastructure or portion of infrastructure constructed below MHW is not onshore infrastructure. The MHW is the standard the State uses, but in the absence of a standard it will mean the average elevation of high water recorded from a rising tide at a particular point or station over a considerable period of time, usually 19 years."" This is from the MMS State Plan Guidelines.

Subject: Question regarding deep gas royalty relief Steve, There have been 51 blocks on 50 leases (2 of the 51 blocks are included in a unit) which have earned a royalty suspension volume (RSV) and used that RSV on production from 68 qualified wells. The magnitude of that production was 303 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas. The data are through June, 2009. In addition, there were 15 leases which earned a royalty suspension supplement (RSS) for drilling an eligible dry hole. Six of these leases did not use any of the RSS that was earned. Four of these six have expired. The other nine leases were able to apply 21 bcf equivalent of the earned RSS to other gas or oil production on the lease or unit. None of the eligible wells or leases were in 200-400 meters of water depth, and none were associated with a qualified well drilled deeper than 20,000 feet subsea after 2005, i.e., none were related to the EPAct provisions.

TAKE

MAR -9 2(18
The Honorable Dianne Feinstein Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Envirorunent, and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Chairman Feinstein:

INAMERICA

This letter updates information provided to you in a February 4, 2008, letter regarding oil and gas royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA) responding to your letter of April 18,2007, to former Secretary Kempthorne. The infonnation below relates to the three items you requested. 1. The current status of negotiations between the Department and the 45 companies holding 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds; a list which shows the companies that have agreed to renegotiate their leases; and the percent of the overall revenue loss that the Department attributes to each company. Currently, there are 43 companies that have record title or operating rights interest in the 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds. While we have had at least preliminary discussions with all companies that have held or currently hold significant interests, most companies appear to be waiting to see the outcome of the Kerr-McGee litigation. This Administration will continue to work with Congress to reach an appropriate resolution of this issue. The Department reached agreements with six companies (Enclosure 1), and they have been paying royalties consistent with the terms of the agreements. Enclosure 2 provides an update on the amount and percentage, attributed to each company, of royalties that would have been paid through December 31, 2008, if price thresholds had applied to these leases. Please note that there are some differences between Enclosures 1 and 2 because the 43 companies listed in Enclosure 1 are current lessees of record title in the 1998 and 1999 leases, whereas, the companies listed in Enclosure 2 are companies with operating rights ownership in those 1998 and 1999 leases that have been or are currently in a producing status. Under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996, companies that are designated operators are primarily liable for royalty payments once leases are in producing status. 2. The current status of the Kerr-McGee legal challenge to the Department's authority to place price thresholds on any deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000; the anticipated resolution date for the case; and the Department's view on congressional legislation reaffirming the Department's authority to place price thresholds. On January 12,2009, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion upholding the District Court and ruling in favor of Kerr-McGee. The Department of Justice is considering the Department's

2

recommendation that a motion be filed requesting the Fifth Circuit reconsider this ruling en

bane.
3. The current status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been foregone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases, and estimates of future foregone royalties from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases and future royalties that may be at risk from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until these issues are resolved; and the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until the Kerr-McGee suit is resolved.
As requested, Enclosure 3 provides an update on the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been forgone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases as of December 31, 2008. Enclosure 4 outlines the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases. The annual amount of royalties increased from $1.1 billion in our February 4,2008, letter to $1.5 billion to date. We will update these figures annually. Enclosure 5a provides a range of estimates, as of January 1,2009, for future royalties from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases that may be at risk due to the KerrMcGee litigation and Enclosure 5b provides estimates of future production and royalty value from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases. The estimates range from $18 billion to $19.0 billion and $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion in current year dollars, respectively. We will continue to send you updates as new information becomes available. A copy of this letter is being sent to all Interior) Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Members. Should you or your staff have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by phone at (202) 208-6734.

Martie, Please see MMS's official statement on BP Atlantis below. Thank you, Brad

The Minerals Management Service received a copy of a letter from a special interest group to the Department of the Interior requesting an investigation into British Petroleum's Atlantis platform, which is operating in the Gulf of Mexico. MMS is currently reviewing the contents of the letter. As a matter of policy, however, we do not publicly discuss whether investigations are ongoing or pending in order to maintain the integrity of the investigation process.

Subject: RE: Oil & Gas leases
Ticora, following up on the response below, I was mistaken regarding separating out the oil and gas leases the report found at the link below. There is no way to re-create lease reports for prior fiscal years from the Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) system. The lease reports are a snapshot of leasing activity in the MRM system on a given day; once that day is passed it is impossible to look back and accurately query the system for lease statistics for historical timeframes. This limitation is based on the way historical lease data is stored in the system. The data from the Offshore Energy and Mineral Management's (OCS offshore) and BLM's (onshore) systems provides the FY lease data from the authorized leasing management agency. If you wish to discuss, please give me a call. Lyn Herdt 202 208-3828

Per our conversation yesterday , we discussed the 10/26/07 data in the ""Leases by category"" table (httR://W'IfW . which you confirmed was for all mineral production types. You indicated you'd look into obtaining data specific to oil and gas leases as reflected in that report. Response: Our folks were working on breaking out the oil and gas data from this report; it will take some time to enter the appropriate queries and have the computer run the report. I'll get back with you today with an ETA.

Tic o ra, The information presented on the MMS's Royalty Revenue Management webpages inclues the following disclaimer that for official lease information, the data should be requested from the leasing management agency (i.e., BLM and MMS's OEMM). However, I believe between the BLM chart you shared yesterday and the attached OEMM generated OCS lease stats, should provide the information you are seeking. Producing and non-producing lease information on this website is compiled for the sole purpose of royalty collection, v erification, and disbursement. For o fficial lease information, please refer to the appropriate leasing management agency: Bureau of Indian Affairs for American Indian leases, Offshore Energy and Minerals Management for Offshore leases, and Bureau of Land Management for Federal Onshore leases. [Emphasis Added) Any differences between the lease data presented on this website and lease data provided by th o se agencies are due primarily to timing issues in the lease administration process and differences in defi n iti o ns of terms.

The BLM's chart includes a n umber of categories f o r their onshore lease data: number of leases, acreage, and the number of ""producible""leases. The atta c hed MMS d ocument presents the OCS lease statistics by Region; the number of OCS leases, the number of producing leases, and the corresponding acreage. This data was provided by MMS's Offshore Energy and Mineral Management Program. For MMS, FY numbers represent a snap shot at the end of the FY. The term ""producing"" means a lease that is in production status as of the date the report is created. I have cc'd Anna Atkins o n, my counterpart at BLM's Office of Congressional

Ticora, The information presented on the MMS's Royalty Revenue Management webpages inclues the following disclaimer that for official lease information, the data should be requested from the leasing management agency (i.e., BLM and MMS's OEMM). However, I believe between the BLM chart you shared yesterday and the attached OEMM generated OCS lease stats, should provide the information you are seeking. Producing and non-producing lease information on this website is compiled for the sole purpose of royalty collection, verification, and disbursement. For official lease information, please refer to the appropriate leasing management agency: Bureau of Indian Affairs for American Indian leases, Offshore Energy and Minerals Management for Offshore leases, and Bureau of Land Management for Federal Onshore leases. [Emphasis Added] Any differences between the lease data presented on this website and lease data provided by those agencies are due primarily to timing issues in the lease administration process and differences in definitions of terms.

The BLM's chart includes a number of categories for their onshore lease data: of leases, acreage, and the number of ""producible""leases.

number

The attached MMS document presents the OCS lease statistics by Region; the number of OCS leases, the number of producing leases, and the corresponding acreage. This data was provided by MMS's Offshore Energy and Mineral Management Program. For MMS, FY numbers represent a snap shot at the end of the FY. The term ""producing"" means a lease that is in production status as of the date the report is created. I have cc'd Anna Atkinson, my counterpart at BLM's Office of Congressional Affairs. Anna should be able to assist you with understanding BLM's definition of their term ""producible.""

Hi Lyn, There have been a few proposals to extend state territorial waters out to 12 miles across the board , and we're trying to get a sense of what the cost of that to the federal government would be. Could you let us know, for each of the last 5 years or so, the amount of royalties that have come from production from the federal/state boundary out to 12 miles? Thanks, --Steve

We just need to get the go ahead from our new appointees after we bring them up to speed.

If we could set up the meeting for the 20 th that would be great. I can make myself available any time that day to accommodate a meeting.

For the numbers presented, the 12mi line was derived by extending the appropriate distance seaward of the existing State-Federal maritime boundary. Due to accuracy concerns, these figures exclude revenues from partial lease blocks that are further dissected by the proposed 12mi line (Le. a fraction of a fraction of a block). The total amount of revenue this could potentially exclude is 3.8% of the total revenue collected for the areas of concern. Therefore, the total revenue numbers presented are AT MOST underestimated by 3.8%.

Table B gives the leasing revenues (royalties plus bonuses for this discussion) that are estimated to be generated from leases issued in potential lease sales held in the draft proposed program planning areas. The total leasing revenues for all proposed sales sum to $368 billion in nominal dollars and $56 billion in present value dollars. (Cash flows are discounted at a 7 percent real interest rate plus the inflation rate to obtain present values.) Table B also gives the states' potential shares of the leasing revenues by applicable region, assuming the same revenue sharing formula of37.5 percent as in GOMESA. They sum to $123 billion in nominal dollars and $18 billion in present value dollars, excluding revenues distributed under section 8(g) of the Act. Based on the projections of net economic value, the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars. It is assumed that Congress enacts legislation under which all leasing revenues with the states will be shared at 37.5 percent under future legislation, for areas where no sales were included in the 2007-2012 program and which were previously under moratoria. Sales in areas already included in the 2007-2012 leasing program are assumed to share revenues only as provided by GOMESA. That is, sharing begins in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico for revenues starting in FY 2017, except certain parts of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico formerly included in the Lease Sale 181 area or due south of that area, where sharing started in 2008. The estimates provided do not take account of the $500 million annual cap on revenue sharing currently provided in GOMESA for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico planning areas.

Notes: Estimates assume revenue sharing occurs without annual revenue sharing caps (currently $500 million/yr in the GOM) Estimates assume legislation granting immediate revenue sharing for States near formerly restricted planning areas ; GOM States share royalties after 2017 Estimates assume that legislation granting revenue sharing for Atlantic and Pacific States also grants same terms for Alaska. Rental revenues are not estimated.

From: Sent: To: Cc: Subject: Herdt, Lyn Wednesday, July 08, 2009 8:41 AM Lance, Linda (Energy) Blythe, Brad J; Haenny, Lesley RE: another revenue question

Attachments: OPP.pdf; OPP Tables A & B - Lease Sale Schedule and Revenues from Lease Sales under OPP.pdf; OPP Proposed Area Maps - Alaska.pdf; OPP Proposed Area Maps - Atlantic.pdf; OPP Proposed Area Maps - CA. pdf; OPP Proposed Area Maps - GOM.pdf Linda, a complete analysis of potential revenues from all OCS areas would be a multi-month project. The best we can offer is to refer you to the revenue analysis/estimate developed for the OPP. The OPP issued in January 09 included an estimate of bonus bids and royalties to be generated from leases issued from the proposed lease sales. I have attached the full OPP for your information. The 2 nd attachment provides Table A - the proposed schedule of lease sales, and Table B - estimate of leasing revenues and state shares from sales that might occur within the areas proposed for leasing. The individual Planning Area maps showing the OPP proposed areas are also attached as separate docs. From my review off S. 1333 The bill repeals GOMESA in its entirety; then establishes a similar revenue sharing program from leases issued as of January 1, 2000. However, the way I'm reading it, revenue sharing under S. 1330 appears to be limited to coastal states that did NOT have oil or gas production within 100 miles as of January 2000. This would eliminate revenue sharing (GOMESA and under S. 1330) to all GOM states, CA, and AK. Revenue sharing pretty much mirrors the GOMESA approach, 37.5% to states based on distance from revenue generating lease;; however, under GOMESA, 20% of funds to a State are allocated to political coastal subdivisions, under S. 1330, that amount is 40%. The annual cap for alLqualified revenues to be shared under GOMESA is $500 million; however, as I read S. 1330, the $500 million annual cap is on the amount going to EACH state and its political coastal. Lyn

From: Lance, Linda (Energy) [mailto:Linda_Lance@energy.senate.gov] Sent: Monday, July 06,20095:12 PM To: Herdt, Lyn; Haenny, Lesley Subject: another revenue question Hi Guys - Wondered if you'd taken a look at Sen. Barrasso's energy bill, S. 1333, introduced before the recess, and particularly Title III. I'm trying to do as accurate an estimate as possible of the loss to the federal treasury that would occur if this bill were enacted. As I read section 301, it would provide states and local governments 37.5% of all receipts received in the fiscal year following the year of enactment from any leases entered into after 1/1 2000 up to an annual cap of $500 million in 2008 dollars. Is it possible to ballpark likely receipts from such leases if we assume this is enacted in 2009 and receipts start flowing to states in 2010? In our files I saw some estimates you all did a few years ago taking receipts out 50-60 years - are those still accurate? They may have assumed moratoria that are no longer in effect. What would you suggest is the most accurate way to estimate this? In the past to get an upper limit we've simply estimated amt of royalties available if all technically and/or economically recoverable resources were produced at the current royalty rate. There may be something more specific to the limitations of this bill that would be better. Or it may be accurate to assume that the $500 million cap will be applicable for theforseeable future since 37.5%

of annual receipts seems to be consistently exceeding that number. Any estimates you have or could develop without significant pain would be much appreciated. Not worth a lot of new analysis, but would appreciate your thoughts. Many thanks, as always. Linda

SUBJECT: Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior on Mutual Concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf

I.

SUMMARY

MMS has been consulting with the military in a collaborative manner at both the planning and operational stages for OCS oil and gas leasing activities to ensure that each agency meets the requirements of its mission while not unduly interfering with the other. This has been accomplished for 25 years under a 1983 MOA between DOl and DoD with no serious conflict.

II.

DISCUSSION:

The basic provisions ofthe MOA between DoD and DOl on Mutual Concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf (Effective July 20, 1983), are to resolve conflicts between the OCS leasing program and the requirements for the DOD to use the OCS for national defense and security, and set forth procedures and steps to follow when OCS lease sales are planned. Section I of the MOA very clearly identify the missions of both Departments: ""We, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior, hereby agree to establish procedures for joint use of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of the Interior (DOl) fully support the national goal of exploration and development of our nation's offshore oil and gas resources. The DOD recognizes that the OCS leasing program of the DOl is an integral part of the nation's energy security program to develop domestic oil and gas resources and thus is important to national defense. The DOl fully supports the requirement for DOD to use the OCS for the national defense/security and to ensure that our armed forces achieve and maintain an optimum state of readiness. We acknowledge that from time to time and from place to place the requirements for mineral exploration/development and defense related activities may conflict. In these cases, we shall reach mutually acceptable solutions to the issues raised by these conflicting requirements, in accordance with the principles and procedures established by this memorandum."" For the past 25 years, the coordination and consultation mechanisms set forth in the MOA have enabled DOl to continue to meet its OCS Lands Act mandate to make OCS resources available for expeditious and orderly development, while still protecting the environment, as well as allowing the DOD to meet its critical national defense and security mission.

III.

Past and On-going Consultations under the MOA

The ""drilling window"" concept is a prime example of successful consultations with Eglin Air Force Base. The drilling window concept was devised to promote a predictable and orderly distribution of surface structures throughout the stipulation area at any given time. This was accomplished by controlling the site of drilling rigs and platforms associated with exploratory drilling to prevent interference with scheduled military missions that might jeopardize the national defense mission or pose an unacceptable risk to life and property. Drilling windows came into being as lease Stipulation No.5 in Sale 79. This stipulation provided for the control of the timing of placement and location of surface structures as well as planned periods of surface structure operation. Windows were implemented using stipulations in subsequent sales as well. An open and closed window concept was proposed that would identify an area of arbitrary size within which exploratory drilling operations could be conducted. The opening and closing of each window would control the starting and stopping of exploratory drilling. All leases within an open drilling area were available for exploration. The first area was determined by whichever company filed a proposed plan that was subsequently approved. The size of the first drilling window was determined by the maximum size and configuration of the safety footprint Eglin was required to maintain during testing operations. The size and configuration of the safety footprint varied depending on the specific missile or armament being tested. Needs were established 3 to 4 years in advance. As plans of exploration were submitted for review by MMS and Eglin AFB, the location of the proposed drilling site was reviewed to determine if Eglin's missile test schedule was still projected to be on time. Eglin initially felt they could only accommodate one open window at a time. After a few years of opening and closing windows, Eglin proposed opening larger windows and was also receptive to opening multiple windows. Another example of ongoing consultations is the lease stipulation concerning operations in the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Area in the Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. This stipulation provides that prior to the placement, location, and planned periods of operation of surface structures on blocks within Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command Operational Area D (Mustang Island Area), the lessee must consult with the Commander, Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command, in order to determine the EP's compatibility with scheduled military operations. The Exploration Plan (EP) shall contain a statement certifying the consultation and indicating whether the Commander, Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command has any objection to activities and schedule of the EP. No permanent structures or debris of any kind are allowed in the area covered by the lease during exploration operations.

MMS continues to work closely with DoD under the existing MOA to ensure we are actively engaged. In the Gulf of Mexico we meet regularly with DOD to discuss past and future leasing in EGOM, past drilling and pending plan filings, new military windows configuration and timing schedule, and discussions of current Military Mission Line and opportunities if any for activity east of the line.

In our Pacific Region we cooperatively developed lease stipulations for areas offshore Vandenberg Air Force Base. These stipulations allow for development of the OCS resources while still allowing Vandenberg Air Force Base to conduct critical missile launches.

After the initial ""nominations"" were cleared for competitive interest (EPAct 05 has a competition clause), a second call was issued for applications. Bluewater Wind has not yet submitted an application for the projects identified as ""Proposed Lease Area 1"" and ""Proposed Lease Area 2"" on this table. The remaining four projects are among the 5 mentioned during this morning's briefing. Note: Winergy has changed its name to Deepwater Wind. o The website includes a map indicating where the projects are off the coast of New Jersey. The table indicates how far from shore. o The Fisherman's Energy of New Jersey met tower will be in approximately 40 feet of water. The two Deepwater projects will be in approximately 90 feet of water, and the Bluewater Wind tower will be in approximately 60 feet of water. Register on April 29 and is available for 3. The Renewable Energy Framework was published in the public inspection at http://www.mms.gov/offsboreLlienewab.leEnergy/index.htm. In addition to establishing a process for granting leases, easements, and rights-of-way for offshore renewable energy development, the new program also establishes methods for sharing revenues generated from OCS renewable energy projects with adjacent coastal States. We mentioned the series of ten Renewable Energy Framework public regulatory workshops that we are planning at various locations around the country. The objectives of these meetings are for the MMS to gather information from the interested and affected parties in the coastal states, to gather information to support the MMS efforts in rulemaking and program development, and to obtain input concerning potential renewable energy activity in specific OCS regions. The meetings will be held during the month of June. I checked with our Renewable Energy Office this afternoon and we are very close to announcing specific dates and locations, I should have that for you tomorrow morning. 4. Attached is a summary of the FY 2010 budget initiatives for the MMS. I believe this answers all of your questions, please let me know if you have any additional needs. Thanks, Cheri

We are looking up the associated rentals. On March 18, Sale 208 (Central GOM) was held. Bid evaluation is ongoing, as of today no leases have yet to be issued. The link to the Stats for Sale 208 is . As you know, it is not guaranteed that all high bids will be accepted and a lessee may choose to not execute a lease even if we accept (in that rare case - but if it does happen, the Government keeps the 1/5th bonus bid). IF al\ high bids on all leases were accepted and the leases were executed, the first year rentals would amount to $18,944,247. FYI, two points: Potential lessees have 11 business days to execute the lease which includes paying the balance of the bonus (the 4/5 balance is due with \ease execution along with the first year rental). For bids that we reject, we return the 1/5th bonus received at the tirne of the sale, Rejected bids are returned with interest if a rejection decision is made. We are checking to see if any leases from the current 5-year program are in production. Thanks, Cheri

Subject: Your question re: GOMESA

Jon, The FY 08 allocations can be found on the link above. Regarding your question on future allocations, the following information was provided for a similar request last week. Please let me know if you have additional questions. Cheri
Cheri Hunter Office of Congressional Affairs Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Minerals Management Service Department of the Interior Ct1JlJLnYJ1&.r@mms.go v
(202) 208-3788

Question : I am interested in the revenues estimated to go to the states of MS, LA, AL, and TX from FY08 to FY16. Answer: While our intent is to allocate revenues by March of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which qualifying revenues are received (a little ahead of the requirement), legally we are obligated to allocate by the end of the fiscal year (September). We are hoping to allocate FY09 revenues earlier than March 2010 if we can,but we cannot commit at this point. The FY 2008 allocation (paid March 2009) was based on the EGOM Sale bonus and first year rentals. The allocations also included small amounts from tracts sold in Sale 205 and Sale 206 that had a portion of their acreage lying east of the eastern planning area/central planning area administrative boundary. FY 2009 allocations (to be paid in 2010) would include rentals (and perhaps royalties if any of those become producing) from those leases and the bonus dollars and first year rentals from Sale 208 ""181 South"" leases. Not only will revenue totals will change each year as rentals are due as some properties switch over to royalty paying, some additional bonus in GOMESA areas will be received. The allocation to the states and subdivisions will change as well -- which is based on an inverse distance relationship between the states/subdivisions and all of the GOMESA areas under lease. So, the revenue totals and the allocation percentages will most likely also change (another factor ... increased areas leased in Sale 208) . We cannot accurately predict future GOMESA revenues by state--- in addition to the factors above, GOMESA properties can be relinquished, operations suspended, and there is no way to predict which blocks will be leased in the future . Theoretically, since the FY07-FY16 allocations are based only on revenues from the two relatively small geographic areas, the percents shared between the four states should not change dramatically. They should stay within +/- 3 percentage points of the FY08 allocation percents. But the amounts that are shared each year will obviously change.

(04/17/0909:01:12) WASHINGTON - A program to expand oil and gas drilling off the Alaska coast was canceled Friday by a federal appeals court that ruled the Bush administration did not properly study the environmental impact.

A three-judge panel in Washington found that the Bush-era Interior Department failed to consider the effect on the environment and marine life before it began the process in August 2005 to expand an oil and gas leasing program in the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi seas. The appeals court ordered the department, now run by President Barack Obama's appointee Ken Salazar, to analyze the areas to determine environmental risks and potential damage before moving ahead with the program. The seas are home to wildlife including polar bears, whales, seals, walruses and seabirds. The lawsuit was brought by three environmental groups that want to protect the ecosystem and the Native Village of Point Hope, Alaska, a tribe that lives off the wildlife on the Chukchi Sea coast. The decision comes at a time when oil and gas producers are finding it increasingly difficult to find new reserves and boost production, at home and abroad. Output from the biggest U.S. oil companies has largely been in decline in the past few years. Even though most people recognize the names of the giant multinationals - Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP and others - they control less than 10 percent of the world's oil reserves. Most proven reserves about 80 percent - are held by national, state-run companies like those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. The Interior Department was reviewing the decision Friday and did not immediately comment. The department had already delayed the leasing program by five years to complete environmental studies. Attorney William Snape, who argued the case for the environmentalists before the appeals court, said the species in the area are already under significant environmental threat because of global warming. He said Interior Secretary Salazar has sent mixed signals on how he'll handle drilling in the outer continental shelf, but the ruling is a chance for the new administration to protect the sensitive areas. ""We're seeing a whole ecosystem potentially collapse,"" Snape said. ""This really is a great opportunity for Salazar to do the right thing."" So far, the Interior Department has only approved one lease sale in the disputed areas, which involved more than 29 million acres in the Chukchi Sea, extending from about 50 miles to 200 miles offshore. The sale in February 2008 attracted 667 bids totaling almost $3.4 billion, the most in any offshore lease sale in Alaska history. The high bids totaled more than $2.6 million. Associated Press Energy Writer John Porretto in Houston contributed to this report.

Subject: Request from Sen. Wicker's staff re : GOMESA
Hi Sarah, Anita asked that I respond to your email from Thursday. While our intent is to allocate revenues by March of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which qualifying revenues are received (a little ahead of the requirement), legally we are obligated to allocate by the end of the fiscal year (September). We are hoping to allocate FY09 revenues earlier than March 2010 if we can, but we cannot commit at this point. The FY 2008 allocation (paid March 2009) was based on the EGOM Sale bonus and first year rentals. The allocations also included small amounts from tracts sold in Sale 205 and Sale 206 that had a portion of their acreage lying east of the eastern planning area/central planning area administrative boundary. FY 2009 allocations (to be paid in 2010) would include rentals (and perhaps royalties if any of those become producing) from those leases and the bonus dollars and first year rentals from Sale 208 ""181 South"" leases. Not only will revenue totals will change each year as rentals are due as some properties switch over to royalty paying, some additional bonus in GOMESA areas will be received. The allocation to the states and subdivisions will change as well -- which is based on an inverse distance relationship between the states/subdivisions and all of the GOMESA areas under lease. So, the revenue totals and the allocation percentages will most likely also change (another factor. .. increased areas leased in Sale 208). We cannot accurately predict future GOMESA revenues by state--- in addition to the factors above, GOMESA properties can be relinquished, operations suspended, and there is no way to predict which blocks will be leased in the future. Theoretically, since the FY07-FY16 allocations are based only on revenues from the two relatively small geographic areas, the percents shared between the four states should not change dramatically. They should stay within +/- 3 percentage points of the FY08 allocation percents. But the amounts that are shared each year will obviously change. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Cheri

Anita, I called the main number at MMS, explained the information I was looking for, and was directed to you. I apologize for this ""out of the blue "" email but appreciate any help you can provide.
I am trying to track down some information regarding the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. I am interested in the revenues estimated to go to the states of MS, LA, AL, and TX from FY0S to FY16. I have the percentage breakdown going to each of the states through FY16 (27% annually to MS, 30% to AL, 32% to LA, and 11% to TX). What I don't know is what this means in terms of dollars estimated to go to each state . I am not sure if those projections even exist but just wanted to check.

To summarize, what do those percentages equate to in terms of dollars (FY0S-FY16)? Again, thanks in advance for any information you may be able to send my way. Sarah Sarah H.

Subject:
Wendy, this email is following up on the outstanding items you had requested. Previously we sent you information on OCS sales, leasing and drilling activity. You had also requested information on the number of OCS sales and plans for exploration , development and production that were denied CZM conSistency by a state. The MMS database does not track information on CZM decisions. NOAA is the agency of record for CZM appeals. The OCS projects that have had consistency denied and been appealed to NOAA are included in the attached document. List 2 in the attachment consolidates all OCS projects. CZM decisions that have been appealed date from the mid 1980's through the 1990's. Since that time, there have been projects that have been neither denied nor approved but held in suspension while additional information is requested . Unlike NEPA, CZMA does not provide for upholding decisions based on incomplete information . Presumably, NOAA will have more information relating to this although it seems that many of these cases remain between companies and states. NOAA mainly becomes involved when a state denies conSistency and then the company can appeal the decision . If no decision is ever rendered, the project is left in a rather difficult state. Additional information on CZMA program can be found at:

Also, the attached summary of OCS Sale litigation was prepared in response to your request. Finally, our folks are pulling together the data on the number of exploration and development plans filed by OCS regions from 1998 to date. I have asked for an ETA and will get back with you as soon as possible.

Hi AnitaI'm seeking some MMS data: For the lease sales held by MMS since (and including) 1998, which have been challenged and who initiated those lawsuits?

9/2112010

I think this information would be most useful to us if it was organized by location (at least by region, but ideally by location), by year: 1. the number of tracts offered 2. the acres offered 3. number of tracts bid on 4. number of acres bid on 5. number of tracts leased 6. Number of acres leased 7. Which, if any, of the land parcels (and the number and acreage involved) included in any of those lease sales were challenged 8. Who in #7 (what entities) challenged the lease sales, and if available, the crux of the challenge 9. the outcome of the challenges in #8 10. A summary by year (not needed by location unless it's easy to break out that way) how many drilling permits were issued , and how many were challenged . I think #1-6 is already on MMS' website , so I'm guessing the real data work is compiling with that list the requests in #7-10. Because the number of lease sales isn't overwhelming, and the number of regions fairly restricted , my hope is that the total aggregation will be manageable. How long do you think this compilation might take to put together? Thanks - and please do feel free call to discuss/ask questions/ask me to clarify .. ..

Cheri

5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)?
(See attached file ""1996-2007LeasingHistory.pdf'). This contains tables showing leases by year leased, year re-Ieased, and water depth as well as graphs depicting the lease history. The focus is on leases that were leased a second time however, there were a few leases that were re-Ieased for a third time. Since these were fairly small numbers, these were not shown by water depth. It would be a fair assumption that most of these re-Ieased for a third time tended to be shallow water. In more recent years, the blocks that have been re-Ieased tend to be the shallow-water blocks. This is related to the primary terms for shallowwater blocks being 5 years and for deepwater blocks being 10 years.

7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GaM?

Subject:

Attachments: UERR and UTRR - leased and unleased by planning area .xls Hi Steve, See answers to your questions regarding the attached spreadsheet in green font below. Our analyst in the Gulf who had been assigned the two remaining questions you had regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report has been occupied with the Secretary's 45-day report. I will check on the status. Thanks, Cheri

From: Feldgus, Steve [mailto:Steve.Feldgus@mail.house.gov] sent: Tuesday, March 10, 2009 5:53 PM
To: Herdt, Lyn Subject: Question about attached sheet
Hi Lyn, You sent us the attached spreadsheet a few weeks ago, and I just wanted to check on a few things. The UTRR numbers are a bit different than the 2006 Assessment - the spreadsheet shows a total of 85.26 billion barrels of UTRR, while the 2006 assessment shows 85.88 billion barrels, which is a minor difference I'm not too concerned about (although I am interested in knowing if these numbers are updated UTRR numbers that supersede what's in the 2006 Assessment). MMS Response: These numbers are not updated (or superseded) UTRR numbers from the 2006 Assessment. The difference between the Total of 8S.26 Billion bbls oil UTRR on the attached spreadsheet and the 85.88 Billion bbls oil from the assessment lies in the Alaska OCS areas of negligible potential that were not reported in the DPP (or on the attached spreadsheet). The areas that make up the difference are: Hope (.1SBbbls oil), Norton (.06 Bbbls oil), Navarin (.13 Bbbls oil), St. George Basin (.21 Bbbls oil), Shumagin (.01 Bbbls oil), and Kodiak (.OS Bbbls oil) . But the big difference is in the UERR, which was 65.61 billion barrels at $60/bbl in the 2006 Assessment, but in the spreadsheets is 52.1 billion barrels at the same price. Is that a reflection of increased commodity costs (steel, etc.), or is there something else behind it?

MMS Response: Yes, as you mention cost increases have had a significant impact on UERR's especially in Alaska. Several significant updates to the economic assumptions were made for the 2008 economic assessment. The most influential change involved the adjustment of costs according to oil prices, where costs follow price trends. This fundamental relationship was not modeled in previous MMS assessments, so economic resource potential was generally over-estimated at high prices and under-estimated at low prices. For the 2008 economic assessment, costs were updated to a higher base price and then adjustments to costs with increasing oil prices were made automatically in a recently improved version of our assessment model (GRASP) . In addition to development and drilling cost increases, gas processing and transportation costs were other important cost updates. These costs are typically input as gas tariffs (Mcf) and do not have an automatic cost-price adjustment in the GRASP model. For Arctic provinces, the gas transportation tariff was increased (+$1.601 Mcf) to reflect the increase in costs for a future gas pipeline. LNG facilities for gas exports were increased by $1. OOIMcf to reflect current costs for new facilities in remote areas as well as for new Jones-Act ships. Also, the value of gas production decreased because of the current assumption regarding the gas price btU-discount. In the 2006 assessment, a $60 oil price was correlated to a gas price of $9. 071Mcf In 2008, a $60 oil price is associated with a $6.41 gas price. Thus, gas value decreased by 30% while processing and transportation costs increased to reflect present conditions. This affected the economic simUlations for both gas and oil prospects. Gas prospects

Q/?l1?010

that were marginal in the 2006 assessment became uneconomic in the current assessment, and the value of oil prospects were negatively affected when oil and gas are co-developed.
The data is presented as being ""as of July 2010"". Does that mean that the numbers in there do not reflect the current situation?

MMS Response: No, the ""as of July 2010"" statement means that the leased and unleased portions of the UTRR's are estimated to reflect what would be available for lease at the start of the new program (July 2010) . As you know, this date has now slipped but that wi"" not have a significant impact on the leased and unleased numbers.

Subject: RE: 1-21-09 Request: Set of questions regarding 2008 Deepwater GOM report Steve, as I mentioned last week, the staff person in the GOM pulling together this information has been sequestered so to speak, working on the ""4S-day"" report. We check continually to make sure it remains on her radar screen. I believe the report is due to be posted on the web around March 30. When we exchanged emails last week about a briefing on regional collaborations, another reason I wanted to avoid this week was the 4S-day report. The Deputy AD for the OEMM program is the best suited for this briefing, and he is the lead for the report. I also found out on Friday that he will be on travel speaking at conferences on March 30 and 31 . So, I'll with the program Chief of Staff to see what we can work out. Cheri

Steve -In response to your January 21 email inquiries regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report:

1. The report mentioned that it was an every-ather-year thing, but Steve believes he has seen interim reports in the other years . (Have there been interim reports?) Will there be an update to the data in this report coming out this year?
The deepwater report is published every-other year (see following). While we are not aware of any interim reports, there is deepwater information that is generated as needed. This is reflected on MMS's Deepwater webpage: http html.

2. What is the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? No. Drillship availability was being pushed into hurricane season so the cruise was delayed until spring 2009 to maximize the chance for a successful endeavor.

3. Was there any criteria used to define BP, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? This is described on page 14 as ""In this report, we define major companies to include BP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and Shell. The grouping of these four entities does not indicate a regulatory conclusion or an analysis of production size. It is merely a convenient category for the purpose of comparison ."" These larger companies, with greater resources to draw on, tend to focus on larger resources that may take greater capital to develop than smaller independents can consider. This distinction simply makes a convenient way to capture the differences in company philosophy that tends to be seen in bidding patterns. 4. On page 20, there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250. Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? Companies do not have to give a reason for forfeiting the 1/5th payment on their bonus bid. Typically, a forfeiture is based on a company acquiring new information after they have placed their bid. If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally determined, the company can choose to limit their loss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale.

5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible.
6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves , but there's no discussion of what

the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement document found at 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

From:

Steve - In response to your January 21 email inquiries regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report: 1. The report mentioned that it was an every-other-year thing , but Steve believes he has seen interim reports in the other years. (Have there been interim reports?) Will there be an update to the data in this report coming out this year? The deepwater report is published every-other year (see following) . While we are not aware of any interim reports , there is deepwater information that is generated as needed . This is reflected on MMS's Deepwater webpage:

2. What is the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? No. Drillship availability was being pushed into hurricane season so the cruise was delayed until spring 2009 to maximize the chance for a successful endeavor. 3. Was there any criteria used to define BP, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? This is described on page 14 as ""In this report, we define major companies to include BP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and Shell. The grouping of these four entities does not indicate a regulatory conclusion or an analysis of production size. It is merely a convenient category for the purpose of comparison ."" These larger companies, with greater resources to draw on, tend to focus on larger resources that may take greater capital to develop than smaller independents can consider. This distinction simply makes a convenient way to capture the differences in company philosophy that tends to be seen in bidding patterns. 4. On page 20, there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250. Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? Companies do not have to give a reason for forfeiting the 1/Sth payment on their bonus bid. Typically, a forfeiture is based on a company acquiring new information after they have placed their bid. If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally

determined, the company can choose to limit their loss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale.
5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to youas soon as possible.

6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves . How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement document found at http://www.mms.o . 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

Steve, the following is in response to questions from your reading of the DPP. Julie Fleming has begun a 2-year assignment as MMS's liaison to the Assistant Secretary's office. Cheri Hunter, from the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Program, has agreed to help us out in our office over the next few months while we hire a new legislative specialist. Please contact Cheri or me if you have any questions concerning the offshore program.

MMS Response to DPP Questions:

On page 7, it says that ""the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars."" Steve didn't see that number split out anywhere in the report (after flipping through to the end), so could MMS break that down ... how much of that is taxes, and how much is profits?
Answer: The sum of Federal corporate taxes and corporate net income generated by the new program is forecasted to be $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 million in present value dollars. The break-down of these measures is, for the nominal dollar case, approximately $400 billion in taxes and $700 billion in net profits. In the present value dollar case, MMS estimates about $50 billion is in taxes and $80 billion in corporate profits.

On page 23, there's a reference to the 1997 MMS cumulative effects report, which is a fulfillment of the OCSLA Section 20(e) requirement that MMS report to Congress on cumulative effects every three years. Have there been more recent cumulative effects reports, and if not, why not?
Answer: The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66), Section 3003 terminated the requirement of submittal of the Report on Effects of Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Activities on Human, Marine, and Coastal Environments under section 20(e) of the oes Lands Act (see http://frwebgate .access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoG.cgi?dbname=104 cong public laws&docid=f:pubI66.104.pdf). The last report required by OeSLA Section 20(e) was published in 1997 and was entitled Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Natural Gas Resource Management Program: Cumulative Effects 1992-1994, oes Report MMS 97-0027. You may download a copy of the report at http://www.mms.gov/itd/hdqrspubs.htm.

On page 25, it mentions a lawsuit against the 2007 5-year plan. Could we get copies of the filings to date and information on status of that lawsuit?
Answer: Solicitor's Office is providing copies and the documents will be delivered to you by February 20.

On page 78, there's a reference to the report, ""Energy Alternatives and the Environment"". The link to this report on the 2007-2012 5-yr program page apparently is broken. Can we get him an electronic copy of that report?
Answer: The link has been fixed on mms.gov. Electronic file attached .

Can we get a map with indications of the distance from the FL coast of the various parts of that DPP area (both the area with proposed full leasing and the area that has the no permanent structure buffer)?
Answer: See attached maps in two formats with contour lines at 25-mile intervals.

On page 90; Table 5 - presents resource estimates by PA for all ""unleased, undiscovered, economically recoverable resources."" Can we provide the UERR for the ""leased"" resources?
Answer: Excel spreadsheet attached.

On page 93/94; the DPP talks about the OECM model for estimating environmental and social costs associated with OCS activities. Can we provide the data ""inputs""?
Answer: The inputs to the model are Exploration and Development (E&D) scenarios and Production Profiles prepared inhouse. MMS considers this information as privileged.

Can we provide information on the recent contract for the Mid-Atlantic study?

Answer: This study consists of a data search and synthesis of existing environmental and socioeconomic information for the northern and central Atlantic area. An evaluation will be made of the relative contributions of physical oceanographic processes to crossshelf transport, as well as the contributions of buoyancy and meteorological forcing to seawater transport. We expect the report to be completed in late 2009. For more information you can go to the website at

Megan, there has been no shared revenues disbursed to the GOM costal states from leases let in the EGOM, as directed by GOMESA. The statute calls for distribution in the FY following receipt of the revenues. Sale 224, held in March 2008, included the GOMESA 181 area acreage in the EGOM. Disbursement of the States' share of the revenues from that March 2008 sale is anticipated to be completed by March 31, 2009. The 181 Area South is the second area GOMESA established immediate revenue sharing. This area, located in the Central GOM, will be included in the upcoming CGOM oes Sale 208, to be held on March 18,2009. The States' share of the revenues from this sale would be disbursed in FY 2010.

Subject: New set of questions
Hi Anita, I've finally gone through the entire 2008 Deepwater GOM report, and loved it, but a few questions came up (shocking , I know)

1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

6.

7.

The report mentioned that it was an every-other-year th ing, but I thought I also saw something interim reports in the other years. Will there be an update to the data in this report coming out this year? What's the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? Was there any criteria used to define BP, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? On page 20, there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250. Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can you give us that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? I'd like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can I get the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can I get similar numbers for all leases in the GOM?

Thanks, --Steve

Subject: Questions from the 5-year plan
Hi Anita, Not quite done reading the Draft Proposed Program yet (up to page 90) , but had a few questions about it: On page 7, it says that ""the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars."" I didn't see that number split out anywhere in the report (after flipping through to the end), so could MMS break that down .. . how much of that is taxes, and how much is profits? On page 23, there's a reference to the 1997 MMS cumulative effects report, which is a fulfillment of the OCSLA Section 20(e) requirement that MMS report to Congress on cumulative effects every three years . Have there been more recent cumulative effects reports, and if not, why not? On page 25, it mentions a lawsuit against the 2007 5-year plan. Could we get some additional details on that lawsuit? On page 68 , it says, ""Areawide leasing allows smaller independent companies to expeditiously acquire, explore and produce low-resource, low-risk fields, while providing larger companies an incentive to pursue technological development in deep water."" How, exactly? On page 78, there's a reference to the report, ""Energy Alternatives and the Environment"" . The link on the 2007-2012 5-yr program page is broken, and my searches on the MMS web site have proven fruitless. Can we get an electronic copy of that report? Regarding the EGOM area, can we get a map with indications of exactly how far the various parts of that DPP area (both the area with proposed full leasing and the area that has the no permanent structure buffer) are from the coast of Florida? Thanks, --Steve

Hi Anita, I'm sure I'm going to be sending you random questions left and right about all the stuff that came out today, and while I could try to compile it all in one document, that could take forever. So I'll just do it one at a time! Anyway, in the Atlantic G&G Fact Sheet, you mention ""multiple applications for permits received by MMS"". Could you tell us how many permits have been received , and for what regions of the Atlantic OCS? Have there been any permit applications filed for new areas in the Pacific OCS? Thanks, --Steve

1:08-CV-00004 (D. Alaska): The sale was held on February 6,2008 and resulted in $2.7 billion in bonus bids from industry. Number of Leases: 486
Issues: Plaintiffs allege that MMS and FWS did not comply with NEP A and ESA regarding impacts to polar bears, walrus, and other species as well as impacts from seismic surveys and oil spills. Status: Filed on January 31,2008 by Native Village of Point Hope, Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and other environmental organizations. Shell and BP intervened. On May 9, 2008, the plaintiffs amended their complaint. On October 17,2008, in a second amended complaint, the plaintiffs challenged the Sale 193 on the ground that MMS failed to consult on the polar bear under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Plaintiffs' brief is due on January 16.

o Beaufort Sea Sale 202 North Slope Borough and Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission
v. MMS, et al., No. 08-35180 (9 th Cir.), on appeal from No. 3-07-CV -0023 (RRB), refiled as No. 3:07-00045 CV (RRB) (D. Alaska),. The sale was held April 2007 drawing bids of$42 million. Number of Non-Producing Leases: 90.

Issues: Plaintiffs allege that the MMS should have done a SEIS rather than make finding that the the previous 4 volume EIS of 2003 sufficiently analyzed the Sale impacts, given the current price scenarios, especially impacts on subsistence hunting, polar bears, and the cumulative effort of global warming. Status: Filed on February 27,2007 seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the lease sale. On April 12, 2007, the court declined to grant a preliminary injunction The district court ruled in the Government's favor on all counts of the lawsuit on January 8, 2008. On February 27,2008, the North Slope Borough and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission filed a notice to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Briefing was completed November 7,2008. Oral argument has not been scheduled.

Gulf of Mexico o Western Gulf of Mexico Sale 200 Kathleen Blanco, Governor, State ofLouisiana v.
Burton; and Kempthorne, Civ. No. 06-3813 (E.D. La.) The sale was held in August 2006. $340 million in high bids. Number of leases 541.
Issues: Compliance with NEPA, CZMA, and Section 19 of the OCSLA occurred. Louisiana's arguments mostly focus on the adequacy ofMMS' environmental assessment in the wake of 2005 hurricanes. Outcome: Filed July 25,2006, and sought to enjoin the sale. The court declined to enjoin the lease sale or the issuance of leases but indicated that plaintiffs may have a likelihood of success on the merits in an opinion dated August 14, 2006. API then filed a motion to enjoin the opening of the bids, which the court declined to do. The parties presented a Settlement

Agreement to the Court which was approved October 24. On February 7,2008, Louisiana was infonned that MMS had satisfied all obligations under the settlement.

CZMA section 307, the federal consistency provision, requires proposed federal actions with reasonably foreseeable effects on any coastal use or resource to be consistent with the enforceable policies of federally approved state Coastal Management Programs (CMPs). CZMA sections 307(c)(3) and (d) require applicants for federal license or permit activities (16 U.S.C. l456(c)(3)(A>>, Outer Continental Shelf(OCS) Plans (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B>>, andfederalfinancial assistance activities (16 U.S.C. 1456(d>> that have reasonably foreseeable effects on any coastal use or resource of a state's coastal zone to certify to affected states that the proposed activities are consistent with the enforceable policies of state CMPs. If a state CMP objects to the certification, the non-federal applicant may appeal the state's objection to the Secretary of Commerce. (Appeals to the Secretary are not available for Federal agency activities under 16 U.S.C 1456(c)(I).) The Secretary will override a state's objection, if the Secretary finds that the activity is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interests of national security. If the Secretary overrides a state's objection, then the federal agency may issue its authorization or funding. If the Secretary does not override a state's objection, the federal agency cannot issue its authorization or funding. The Secretary's decision is based on the administrative record compiled for an appeal. The Secretarial Appeal regulations are 15 C.F.R. part 930, subpart H (sections 930 .120-131), as amended 71 Fed. Reg. 787-831 (January 5, 2006), and 71 Fed. Reg. 75864-75865 (Dec. 19,2006). There are 34 federally approved state CMPs. Since approval of the first CMP in 1978, tens of thousands of federal license or permit activities, OCS oil and gas activities, and federal financial assistance activities have been reviewed for consistency . States have concurred with approximately 95 percent of these actions. The Secretarial appeals are summarized in the table below and described in the five lists below:

Attachments: elMA appealsdecisionlist100608 .pdf; oes Sale Litigation summary 1-09.doc Wendy, this email is following up on the outstanding items you had requested. Previously we sent you information on oes sales, leasing and drilling activity. You had also requested information on the number of oes sales and plans for exploration, development and production that were denied elM consistency by a state. The MMS database does not track information on elM decisions. NOAA is the agency of record for elM appeals. The oes projects that have had consistency denied and been appealed to NOAA are included in the attached document. List 2 in the attachment consolidates al\ oes projects. elM decisions that have been appealed date from the mid 1980's through the 1990's. Since that time, there have been projects that have been neither denied nor approved but held in suspension while additional information is requested. Unlike NEPA, elMA does not provide for upholding decisions based on incomplete information. Presumably, NOAA will have more information relating to this although it seems that many of these cases remain between companies and states. NOAA mainly becomes involved when a state denies consistency and then the company can appeal the decision. If no decision is ever rendered, the project is left in a rather difficult state. Additional information on elMA program can be found at:

Also, the attached summary of oes Sale litigation was prepared in response to your request. Finally, our folks are pulling together the data on the number of exploration, development and production plans filed by oes regions from 1998 to date. I have asked for an ETA and will get back with you as soon as possible.

362748-mms5-pdf-1-1-3,"United States Department of the Interior BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT, REGULATION, AND ENFORCEMENT Washington, DC 20240 December 6, 2010 Joe Stephens The Washington Post 1150 15th Street N.W. Washington, D.C. 20071 REF:MMS-2010-00243 Dear Mr. Stephens, This is in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated June 2, 2010 and received in this office on June 3, 2010. In your request, you sought ""correspondence since January 1, 2004, between the Minerals Management Service (now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE>> and members of Congress and their staff members, and all correspondence between the Minerals Management Service (BOEMRE) and Congressional committees and their staff members."" On November 18,2010 BOEMRE sent you approximately 1,553 pages of documents responsive to your request. We also indicated that we would send additional documents as soon as possible. Today we are writing to provide you with a second partial response. Enclosed are approximately 1,243 pages of documents responsive to your request. Several pages have been partially redacted citing the following exemptions:

Exemption 2 of the FOIA (5 U.S.c. ? 552 (b)(2>> Exemption 6 of the FOIA (5 U.S.c. ? 552 (b)(6>> Exemption 2:
Exemption 2 protects from public disclosure records that are related to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. It includes two distinct categories of records: ""Low 2"" is dealing with internal matters of a relatively trivial nature for which there is no legitimate public interest or benefit; and is applicable when it would impose an administrative burden on the agency to process and release the requested records. ""High 2"" is more substantive, the disclosure of which would allow circumvention of a statute or agency regulation. The premise under ""high 2"" is that disclosure would not benefit those attempting to violate the law and avoid detection.

2

We have determined that fixed conference call codes belong to the category of information likely to result in hannful circumvention under ""high 2.""
Exemption 6: Personal cellular telephone numbers; personal email addresses; residential addresses; residential telephone numbers:

When disclosure of information about a particular individual is requested, we must determine whether release of the information would constitute a clearly ""unwarranted"" invasion of the individual's privacy. NARA v. Favish, 124 S. Ct. 1570, 1580 (2004). To make this determination, we are required to perform a ""balancing test."" This means we must weigh the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to disclosure.
(1)

(2)

(3)

First, we must determine whether the individual has a discemable privacy interest in the information that has been requested. Next, we must determine whether release of this information would serve ""the public interest generally"" (i.e., whether it would ""shed light on the performance of the agency's statutory duties""). Finally, we must determine whether the public interest in disclosure is greater than the privacy interest of the individual in withholding.

The information that we are withholding consists solely of the above category of information and was determined that the individuals to whom this information pertains have a substantial privacy interest in it. Additionally, we have determined that the disclosure of this information would shed little or no light on the performance of the agency's statutory duties and that the public interest to be served by its disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals in question, in withholding it. Nat'l Ass'n of Retired Fed. Employees v. Homer, 879 F.2d 873, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Mr. Timothy Baker with the Office of the Solicitor was consulted in reaching these decisions. If you disagree with this determination, you have the right to appeal under Department of the Interior regulation at 43 CFR Part 2, Subpart D, by writing to: ATTN: FO IA Appeals Office Office of the Solicitor Mail Stop 6556 1849 C. Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20240 The FOIA Appeals Office must receive your FOIA appeal no later than 30 workdays from the date of the final letter or 30 workdays after receipt of any records that are provided to you responding to your FOIA request. Appeals arriving or delivered after 5 p.m. E.T., Monday through Friday, will be deemed received on the next workday. The appeal must be marked, both on the envelope and the face of the appeal letter, with the legend ""FREEDOM OF INFORMA nON APPEAL.""

3

You must include with your appeal, copies of all correspondence between you and the bureau concerning your FOIA request, including copy of your original FOIA request and this letter. Failure to include this documentation with your appeal will result in the Department's rejection of your appeal.

362747-mms4-pdf-67-315-316,"CHALLENGES TO OFFSHORE LEASE SALES Alaska o Chukchi Sea Sale 193 Native Village of Point Hope et al. v. Kempthorne et al., No.
1:08-CV-00004 (D. Alaska): The sale was held on February 6,2008 and resulted in $2.7 billion in bonus bids from industry. Number of Leases: 486
Issues: Plaintiffs allege that MMS and FWS did not comply with NEPA and ESA regarding impacts to polar bears, walrus, and other species as well as impacts from seismic surveys and oil spills. Status: Filed on January 31,2008 by Native Village of Point Hope, Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and other environmental organizations. Shell and BP intervened. On May 9, 2008, the plaintiffs amended their complaint. On October 17,2008, in a second amended complaint, the plaintiffs challenged the Sale 193 on the ground that MMS failed to consult on the polar bear under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Plaintiffs' brief is due on January 16.

o

Beaufort Sea Sale 202 North Slope Borough and Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission
v. MMS, et al., No. 08-35180 (9 th Cir.), on appeal from No. 3-07-CV-0023 (RRB), refiled as No. 3:07-00045 CV (RRB) (D. Alaska),. The sale was held April 2007 drawing bids of$42 million. Number of Non-Producing Leases: 90.
Issues: Plaintiffs allege that the MMS should have done a SEIS rather than make finding that the the previous 4 volume EIS of 2003 sufficiently analyzed the Sale impacts, given the current price scenarios, especially impacts on subsistence hunting, polar bears, and the cumulative effort of global warming. Status: Filed on February 27,2007 seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the lease sale. On April 12,2007, the court declined to grant a preliminary injunction The district court ruled in the Government's favor on all counts of the lawsuit on January 8,2008. On February 27, 2008, the North Slope Borough and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission filed a notice to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Briefing was completed November 7,2008. Oral argument has not been scheduled.

Gulf of Mexico o Western Gulf of Mexico Sale 200 Kathleen Blanco, Governor, State of Louisiana v. Burton; and Kempthorne, Civ. No. 06-3813 (E.D. La.) The sale was held in August 2006. $340 million in high bids. Number of leases 541.
Issues: Compliance with NEPA, CZMA, and Section 19 of the OCSLA occurred. Louisiana's arguments mostly focus on the adequacy ofMMS' environmental assessment in the wake of 2005 hurricanes. Outcome: Filed July 25, 2006, and sought to enjoin the sale. The court declined to enjoin the lease sale or the issuance of leases but indicated that plaintiffs may have a likelihood of success on the merits in an opinion dated August 14,2006. API then filed a motion to enjoin the opening of the bids, which the court declined to do. The parties presented a Settlement

2

Agreement to the Court which was approved October 24. On February 7, 2008, Louisiana was informed that MMS had satisfied all obligations under the settlement.

362746-mms4-pdf-66-304-314,"Appeals to the Secretary of Commerce Under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) - October 6, 2008
CZMA section 307, the federal consistency provision, requires proposed federal actions with reasonably foreseeable effects on any coastal use or resource to be consistent with the enforceable policies of federally approved state Coastal Management Programs (CMPs). CZMA sections 307(c)(3) and (d) require applicants for federal license or permit activities (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(A)), Outer Continental Shelf(OCS) Plans (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)), andfederalfinancial assistance activities (16 U.S.C. 1456(d)) that have reasonably foreseeable effects on any coastal use or resource of a state's coastal zone to certify to affected states that the proposed activities are consistent with the enforceable policies of state CMPs.
If a state CMP objects to the certification, the non-federal applicant may appeal the state's objection to the Secretary of Commerce. (Appeals to the Secretary are not available for Federal agency activities under 16 U.S.C 1456(c)(1).) The Secretary will override a state's objection, if the Secretary finds that the activity is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interests of national security. If the Secretary overrides a state's objection, then the federal agency may issue its authorization or funding. Ifthe Secretary does not override a state's objection, the federal agency cannot issue its authorization or funding. The Secretary's decision is based on the administrative record compiled for an appeal. The Secretarial Appeal regulations are 15 C.F.R. part 930, subpart H (sections 930.120-131), as amended 71 Fed. Reg. 787-831 (January 5, 2006), and 71 Fed. Reg. 75864-75865 (Dec. 19,2006).

There are 34 federally approved state CMPs. Since approval of the first CMP in 1978, tens of thousands of federal license or permit activities, OCS oil and gas activities, and federal financial assistance activities have been reviewed for consistency. States have concurred with approximately 95 percent of these actions. The Secretarial appeals are summarized in the table below and described in the five lists below:

Des Sale Litigation summary 1-...

Wendy. this email is following up on the outstanding items you had requested . Previously we sent you information on oes sales , leasing and drilling activity. You had also requested information on the number of oes sales and plans for exploration, development and production that were denied elM consistency by a state. The MMS database does not track information on elM decisions. NOAA is the agency of record for elM appeals. The oes projects that have had consistency denied and been appealed to NOAA are included in the attached document. List 2 in the attachment consolidates all oes projects. elM decisions that have been appealed date from the mid 1980's through the 1990's. Since that time, there have been projects that have been neither denied nor approved but held in suspension while additional information is requested . Unlike NEPA, elMA does not provide for upholding decisions based on incomplete information. Presumably, NOAA will have more information relating to this although it seems that many of these cases remain between companies and states. NOAA mainly becomes involved when a state denies consistency and then the company can appeal the decision. If no decision is ever rendered , the project is left in a rather difficult state. Additional information on elMA program can be found at:

http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov Iconsistency/we1come.html
Also, the attached summary of oes Sale litigation was prepared in response to your request. Finally, our folks are pulling together the data on the number of exploration, development and production plans filed by oes regions from 1998 to date. I have asked for an ETA and will get back with you as soon as possible.

To: Gonzales-Evans, Anita Subject: data inquiry--Iease sales and challenges Hi Anita I'm seeking some MMS data: For the lease sales held by MMS since (and including) 1998, which have been challenged and who initiated those lawsuits? I think this information would be most useful to us if it was organized by location (at least by region, but ideally by location), by year: 1. the number of tracts offered 2. the acres offered 3. number of tracts bid on 4. number of acres bid on 5. number of tracts leased 6. Number of acres leased 7. Which, if any, of the land parcels (and the number and acreage involved) included in any of those lease sales were challenged 8. Who in #7 (what entities) challenged the lease sales, and if available, the crux of the challenge 9. the outcome of the challenges in #8 10. A summary by year (not needed by location unless it's easy to break out that way) how many drilling permits were issued, and how many were challenged. I think #1-6 is already on MMS' website, so I'm guessing the real data work is compiling with that list the requests in #7-10. Because the number of lease sales isn't overwhelming, and the number of regions fairly restricted, my hope is that the total aggregation will be manageable. How long do you think this compilation might take to put together? Thanks - and please do feel free call to discuss/ask questions/ask me to clarify ....

Thank you again for all the information you provided us about MMS' role in regulating offshore wind projects. I was wondering if you had any further information about the recent FERC announcement that FERC would regulate OCS development - it seems limited to wave power. Is that how you understand it? What effect would that have on offshore wind projects that incorporate wave energy capturing technology into their turbine systems? If you have insight into this, please let me know.

The US Corp of Engineers has authority for navigational safety under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Any fixed structure is required to obtain a navigational safety permit from the COE, which can either be a site specific or area wide permit. The Coast Guard is responsible for the navigational ""aids"" such as lights, etc. The pertinent CG OCS regs can be found at Title 33, subchapter. As you may know, the COE issued a section 10 navigational permit for Cape Wind's met (data collection) towers now in place. Once MMS issues the Cape Wind final EIS, the COE will use that document in their decision making process on a section 10 navigational safety permit for the location of the tower facilities that would be installed for the Cape Wind energy facility. IF the Cape Wind project is permitted by MMS, Cape Wind would not be able to install any facilities unless they receive a section 10 permit from the COE. The USCG and COE would be able to provide you with more substantive information on their programs.

Subject: FW: MMS and the Five Year Plan

Beau - It is good to hear from you. I hope you will be able to take at least a short break for the Holidays and rest up for the 111 th Congress. I am responding to your drafting request to Jon. Attached is draft amendment language to the OCSLA to shorten the process required to develop a new 5-Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program. Currently, the 5-Year process takes about 2 years and has four basic steps beginning with (1) publication of the Request For Information (RFI), followed by 45 day comment period; (2) publication of a Draft Proposed Program (DPP), followed by 60 day comment period; (3) publication of the Proposed Program, followed by 90 day comment period; (4) publication of a Proposed Final Program, followed by a 60 day period with Congress; then final approval (See the attached timetable). The attached draft language would shorten the time required to develop a 5-Year program by eliminating the DPP step. The draft language does not change any NEPA requirements or timeframes. The elimination of the DPP step would simplify the process, reduce MMS's workload significantly, as well as reviewers and commenters, and shorten the overall 5-Year development process by about three to four months,

362741-mms4-pdf-61-287-291,"Royalty In Kind Programs
Most nations do not base their ""take"" on a royalty system similar to ours, so a Royalty in Kind (RIK) program would be rare. In addition, in many countries the government's national oil company controls much of the production, with other private sector companies involved in exploration and production activities through service contracts or production sharing agreements. In the U.S. the Navajo Nation and the State of Texas have RIK programs, and in Canada, the Province of Alberta has an established oil RIK program. The summary information provided below on these 3 programs was extracted from a combination of publicly available information and MMS RIK benchmarking studies.

A. Navajo Nation Oil RIK Program The Navajo Nation is the largest oil producing Indian reservation in the United States. The revenue from the sale of Navajo Nation oil is one of the main sources of income to the Tribe. In 1996, the Navajo Nation made the decision to take their royalty oil in-kind and market their oil to the two regional refineries currently owned by Western Refining. The Navajo Nation utilizes the Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Company to aggregate and market their royalty oil. Based on 2007 reported figures, the Navajo Nation takes approximately 95 percent of their royalty oil in-kind and markets the oil through the Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Company. The Navajo Nation feels that they can leverage their production and command a premium over and above what the Nation would receive for the oil in value from the operating companies. B. The State of Alaska The State of Alaska has had an RIK program since the early 1980's primarily for the purposes of economic development, i.e., to ensure a stable supply of oil to refineries located in Alaska. Under Alaskan law, the Commissioner of Natural Resources is compelled to take determines that taking royalty in value is in the best interest of the state. All RIK contract terms greater than one year require legislative approval. In 2008, two-thirds of oil and gas royalty in kind unless he Alaska's state oil royalty production or approximately 50,000 barrels a day is taken in kind and sold under one long term contract. The State of Alaska has never entered into a gas RIK contact.

c. Texas General Land Office RIK Programs The Texas General Land Office (GLO) takes approximately 37 percent of its gas production and nearly 45 percent of its oil production in kind from State leases. The GLO's oil is sold by competitive bid at the royalty measurement point every 6 months. Premia over po stings are typically received. GLO staff asserts that RIK revenues for oil and gas are some 5 percent and 7 percent, more than in value revenues, respectively.
The GLO's gas RIK program is statutorily mandated to provide gas to State facilities as an alternative to services provided by the local utilities. The program has two primary goals: 1) enhance the School Fund; and 2) streamline the GLO royalty program. The State facilities are GLO's primary customers, although excess gas is sold on the spot

2 market. Most gas is not processed, but when it is, processing fees are paid for in kind with liquids. The State sells approximately 1 billion cubic feet per month from 100 State leases in the Gulf. On average, the program has resulted in an overall revenue enhancement of $11 million for the State, comprised of additional revenues of $1 million annually for the School Fund due to spot market sales, and $10 million in savings from decreased gas prices for State facilities by cutting out the local utilities. Five staff operate the program. The delivery point for lessee-provided gas is ""where the lessee historically has sold the gas."" GLO does not engage in any price hedging or other risk management tools.

D. Province of Alberta Oil RIK Program The Crude Oil Operations Division of Alberta Energy has managed a large-scale oil RIK program since 1974. This statutorily mandated program took and sold all lease production (lessors' AND producers' shares) from 1974 until deregulation in 1985. From 1985 until 1996, Alberta Energy took, marketed, and sold its ""Crown"" (royalty) portion. The marketing/sales function was privatized in June 1996, with three private marketers now selling Crown production. Currently, the Crown's production is nearly 150,000 barrels per day (by comparison, the Gulf of Mexico royalty share is 165,000 barrels/day). Natural gas royalties are paid in value, with prices set by the Province. Approximately 32 staff (including management and secretarial) operate the crude oil RIK program. By comparison, some 90 personnel operate the gas in value program which generates annual revenues roughly equal to the oil program.
The three marketing agents combine Crown production with their own equity production and transport the mix downstream to oil refineries primarily in the Midwest of Canada and the United States. The oil is sold to refineries and the proceeds are split pro rata according to volumes contributed to the collective volume. The theory behind the process is that, by combining the Crown and marketer volumes before sales, the marketing agent has an incentive to maximize Crown proceeds. By regulation, the Province's marketing agent must not have any ownership interests in refineries and must have equity production. Further, the agents can not subject Crown production to financial hedges or other risk management activities. Agents are hired for a 5-year term and they are paid a 5 cent (Canadian)/barrel fee. The 500 oil tank battery operators deliver Crown production to a pipeline interconnect or battery, with the Province paying for transportation by check. These operators report these volumes monthly to Alberta Energy. Imbalances are settled in cash, with the Province by regulation setting monthly prices for each of 5,000 batteries based on netting back from the agent's proceeds. The larger imbalances may, however, be settled in kind. The pipeline company also reports volume receipts into the pipeline by interconnect and operator. Alberta Energy reconciles the two volume reports. The agent monthly reports inventory, delivery, and sales volumes, and expenses incurred for both its equity and the crown volumes, and remits a check to the Province. Source sales documents are sent in monthly for the limited amount of sales transactions, so that ""real time"" auditing is performed (i.e., the month after production/sales).

3

The agents' performance is measured against a posted price benchmark every 6 months. The Alberta posted price indices used reportedly differ from those in the United States but are most comparable to market center index prices for the crude oil cash market in the Gulf of Mexico region (e.g., Empire or St. James). If agents do not meet the benchmark, . their contract can be terminated. Three agents were chosen so that if one or two marketers do not at least equal the benchmark performance measure, there would be other marketer(s) to assume the outstanding production. In addition to the benchmark measurement and monthly review of sales source documents, the Province hires an independent contractor to audit the agents and report to Alberta Energy. Results indicate that a gross enhancement of oil values of 12 cents (Canadian) per barrel has occurred, with a net uplift of7 cents (Canadian) after the marketing fee is paid. According to Alberta Energy, the enhancement results from: 1) ensuring a security of supply oflarge volumes to refiners; and 2) movement of the Crown's sales point away from remote areas with little refining capacity to areas of many refineries with more demand for crude volumes.

E. U.S. Royalty-in-Kind Program
Through the Royalty in Kind (RIK) Program, the Minerals Management Service takes royalties on crude oil and natural gas production in amount or ""in kind"" from the Federal lessee rather than via a cash payment, or ""in value"" method. The MMS then sells that crude oil or natural gas production competitively on the open market. Through the competitive sales process, the RIK Program increases the return on the American taxpayers' crude oil and natural gas royalty assets. RIK and royalty-in-value are used in tandem, based on which approach provides the greatest benefit in a particular situation. The RIK Program is meeting its objectives to improve government efficiencies, reduce regulatory costs and reporting requirements, shorten the compliance cycle, and ensure a fair return on the public's royalty assets. The RIK Program provides several economic benefits for the American public including: o o Lower administrative costs - The program reduces administrative costs by reducing the number of costly reviews, audits, and disputes over payment. Time value of money - Additional benefits accrue to the government due to earlier receipt of royalty payments under the RIK Program, because RIK sales contracts require earlier payments than in value royalties. Increased revenue - The government receives increased royalty receipts by obtaining higher sales values for RIK production and by paying lower operational costs for transporting and processing RIK production.

o

More than $63 million in additional benefits was achieved for the Federal Government and American taxpayer in FY 2007 through the Royalty in Kind Program. The FY 2007 revenue benefits included:

4

MMS/State RIK Partnerships
The MMS continues to jointly engage in RIK activities under a series of memorandums of understanding with the States of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Wyoming. For 8(g) leases, the uplift is calculated on a pipeline-by-pipeline basis and each pipeline can include a mixture of Federal and 8(g) production and a mixture of 8(g) from different States. Therefore, for 8(g) State partnerships, we are unable to accurately determine the estimated RIK revenue gain/loss when compared to the estimated RIV value. For Wyoming there was a $13.6 million estimated RIK revenue gain when compared to the estimated RIV value.

RIKISPR Initiative Program The RIK Program has been supplying royalty oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) fill initiative program since 1999. Under this program, the Department of the Interior contracts for the delivery of Federal royalty oil to market centers along the Gulf Coast, where ownership of the oil is then transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Energy. DOE then awards contracts for the exchange of the Federal royalty oil at the market centers for physical oil deliveries to the SPR. In FY 2007 and FY 2008, more than 22.4 million barrels of crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico were delivered to the Department of Energy to exchange for crude of suitable quality to add to the SPR, helping strengthen national energy security.

362740-mms4-pdf-60-282-286,"Royalty In Kind Programs
Most nations do not base their ""take"" on a royalty system similar to ours, so a Royalty in Kind (RIK) program would be rare. In addition, in many countries the government's national oil company controls much of the production, with other private sector companies involved in exploration and production activities through service contracts or production sharing agreements. In the U.S. the Navajo Nation and the State of Texas have RIK programs, and in Canada, the Province of Alberta has an established oil RIK program. The summary information provided below on these 3 programs was extracted from a combination of publicly available information and MMS RIK benchmarking studies.

A. Navajo Nation Oil RIK Program The Navajo Nation is the largest oil producing Indian reservation in the United States. The revenue from the sale of Navajo Nation oil is one of the main sources of income to the Tribe. In 1996, the Navajo Nation made the decision to take their royalty oil in-kind and market their oil to the two regional refineries currently owned by Western Refining. The Navajo Nation utilizes the Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Company to aggregate and market their royalty oil. Based on 2007 reported figures, the Navajo Nation takes approximately 95 percent of their royalty oil in-kind and markets the oil through the Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Company. The Navajo Nation feels that they can leverage their production and command a premium over and above what the Nation would receive for the oil in value from the operating companies. B. The State of Alaska The State of Alaska has had an in kind program since the early 1980's primarily for the purposes of economic development, i.e., to ensure a stable supply of oil to refineries located in Alaska. Under Alaskan law, the Commissioner of Natural Resources is compelled to take oil and gas royalty in kind unless he determines that taking royalty in value is in the best interest of the state. All royalty in kind contract terms greater than one year require legislative approval. In 2008, two-thirds of Alaska's state oil royalty production or approximately 50,000 barrels a day is taken in kind and sold under one long term contract. The State of Alaska has never entered into a gas royalty in kind contact.
C. Texas General Land Office RIK Programs The Texas General Land Office (GLO) takes approximately 37 percent of its gas production and nearly 45 percent of its oil production in kind from State leases. The GLO's oil is sold by competitive bid at the royalty measurement point every 6 months. Premia over po stings are typically received. GLO staff asserts that RIK revenues for oil and gas are some 5 percent and 7 percent, more than in value revenues, respectively.

The GLO's gas RIK program is statutorily mandated to provide gas to State facilities as an alternative to services provided by the local utilities. The program has two primary goals: 1) enhance the School Fund; and 2) streamline the GLO royalty program. The

2

State facilities are GLO's primary customers, although excess gas is sold on the spot market. Most gas is not processed, but when it is, processing fees are paid for in kind with liquids. The State sells approximately 1 billion cubic feet per month from 100 State leases in the Gulf. On average, the program has resulted in an overall revenue enhancement of $11 million for the State, comprised of additional revenues of $1 million annually for the School Fund due to spot market sales, and $10 million in savings from decreased gas prices for State facilities by cutting out the local utilities. Five staff operate the program. The delivery point for lessee-provided gas is ""where the lessee historically has sold the gas."" GLO does not engage in any price hedging or other risk management tools.

D. Province of Alberta Oil RlK Program The Crude Oil Operations Division of Alberta Energy has managed a large-scale oil RIK program since 1974. This statutorily mandated program took and sold all lease production (lessors' AND producers ' shares) from 1974 until deregulation in 1985. From 1985 until 1996, Alberta Energy took, marketed, and sold its ""Crown"" (royalty) portion. The marketing/sales function was privatized in June 1996, with three private marketers now selling Crown production. Currently, the Crown's production is nearly 150,000 barrels per day (by comparison, the Gulf of Mexico royalty share is 165,000 barrels/day). Natural gas royalties are paid in value, with prices set by the Province. Approximately 32 staff (including management and secretarial) operate the crude oil RIK program. By comparison, some 90 personnel operate the gas in value program which generates annual revenues roughly equal to the oil program.
The three marketing agents combine Crown production with their own equity production and transport the mix downstream to oil refineries primarily in the Midwest of Canada and the United States. The oil is sold to refineries and the proceeds are split pro rata according to volumes contributed to the collective volume. The theory behind the process is that, by combining the Crown and marketer volumes before sales, the marketing agent has an incentive to maximize Crown proceeds. By regulation, the Province's marketing agent must not have any ownership interests in refineries and must have equity production. Further, the agents can not subject Crown production to financial hedges or other risk management activities. Agents are hired for a 5-year term and they are paid a 5 cent (Canadian)/barrel fee. The 500 oil tank battery operators deliver Crown production to a pipeline interconnect or battery, with the Province paying for transportation by check. These operators report these volumes monthly to Alberta Energy. Imbalances are settled in cash, with the Province by regulation setting monthly prices for each of 5,000 batteries based on netting back from the agent's proceeds. The larger imbalances may, however, be settled in kind. The pipeline company also reports volume receipts into the pipeline by interconnect and operator. Alberta Energy reconciles the two volume reports. The agent monthly reports inventory, delivery, and sales volumes, and expenses incurred for both its equity and the crown volumes, and remits a check to the Province. Source sales documents are sent in

3 monthly for the limited amount of sales transactions, so that ""real time"" auditing is performed (i.e., the month after production/sales). The agents' performance is measured against a posted price benchmark every 6 months. The Alberta posted price indices used reportedly differ from those in the United States but are most comparable to market center index prices for the crude oil cash market in the Gulf of Mexico region (e.g., Empire or St. James). If agents do not meet the benchmark, their contract can be terminated. Three agents were chosen so that if one or two marketers do not at least equal the benchmark performance measure, there would be other marketer(s) to assume the outstanding production. In addition to the benchmark measurement and monthly review of sales source documents, the Province hires an independent contractor to audit the agents and report to Alberta Energy. Results indicate that a gross enhancement of oil values of 12 cents (Canadian) per barrel has occurred, with a net uplift of7 cents (Canadian) after the marketing fee is paid. According to Alberta Energy, the enhancement results from: 1) ensuring a security of supply oflarge volumes to refiners; and 2) movement of the Crown's sales point away from remote areas with little refining capacity to areas of many refineries with more demand for crude volumes.

E. U.S. Royalty-in-Kind Program Through the Royalty in Kind (RIK) Program, the Minerals Management Service takes royalties on crude oil and natural gas production in amount or ""in kind"" from the Federal lessee rather than via a cash payment, or ""in value"" method. The MMS then sells that crude oil or natural gas production competitively on the open market. Through the competitive sales process, the RIK Program increases the return on the American taxpayers' crude oil and natural gas royalty assets. RIK and royalty-in-value are used in tandem, based on which approach provides the greatest benefit in a particular situation.
The RIK Program is meeting its objectives to improve government efficiencies, reduce regulatory costs and reporting requirements, shorten the compliance cycle, and ensure a fair return on the public's royalty assets. The RIK Program provides several economic benefits for the American public including: o o Lower administrative costs - The program reduces administrative costs by reducing the number of costly reviews, audits, and disputes over payment. Time value of money - Additional benefits accrue to the government due to earlier receipt of royalty payments under the RIK Program, because RIK sales contracts require earlier payments than in value royalties. Increased revenue - The government receives increased royalty receipts by obtaining higher sales values for RIK production and by paying lower operational costs for transporting and processing RIK production.

More than $63 million in additional benefits was achieved for the Federal Government and American taxpayer in FY 2007 through the Royalty in Kind Program. The FY 2007 revenue benefits included: o o o $56.5 million in increased revenues from sales in open and competitive markets and by paying lower operational costs for transportation and processing; $3.5 million in administrative savings; and $3 million for time value of money benefit.

More than $150 million in additional benefits has been achieved since the program became fully operational: $63 million, $31.2 million, $36 million and $19.5 million in FY 2007,2006,2005 and 2004, respectively.

Steve, following your conference call with Harry Luten in our GOM office regarding an oes benefits study, you had asked if MMS could provide information about onshore job creation numbers due to oes drilling activity, in those lower 48 states that have drilling activity off their shores - so, eA, TX, LA, MS, and AL; and for Florida if there is any job creation in Florida due to industry DeS activity. For immediate assistance, attached are two pieces of information from the Final EIS for the current 5-Year Program for 2007-2010. These include a discussion of impacts from routine operations on population, employment and regional income (pages IV-92, 93 and conclusions on 94) and Table IV-7 that includes employment and labor income estimates for the 5 Gulf Region states. Our folks believe that they will be able to provide you with more up to date oes related employment estimates in June. MMS uses the MAG-PLAN model to develop its employment estimates and is currently readying a contract to update this model; we will be able to use more recent employment multiplier data and work on your request concurrently with similar modeling work. Have a great weekend.

Routine Operations In 2005, the MMS developed a new economic impact model called MAG-PLAN (MMS Alaska-GOM Model Using stage process of the older MMS models (Saha et aI., 2005). The first-stage estimates the expenditures required to sUPI exploration and development scenario, and allocates these expenditures to the various industrial sectors in the onshor, activities are meant to be comprehensive, including exploration drilling, platform fabrication and installation, pipelim various other construction and maintenance functions required to support the phases of development. The explor provided by MMS Resource Evaluation Division, are estimates of the oil- and gas-related activities that could plaus proposed action. High- and low-range estimates of activity drawn from this scenario form the basis for a range of e: income effects. The second step in the process is estimating how the initial dollars spent in a geographic area reverberate through the I uses multipliers taken from the widely used IMPLAN model to estimate the employment, labor income, and other e( economic effects, the model estimates the direct, indirect, induced, and total effects. In standard usage, the direct em the oil and gas industry as a result of the projects being analyzed, as well as the employment, income, and other suc Indirect effects are those that arise from subsequent rounds of spending by contractors, vendors, and other business spending of worker households. However, while total effects remain the same, most ""direct"" MAG-PLAN estimates and induced effects. MAG-PLAN direct effects can be thought of as the effects of local payroll and nonpayroll expel as well as of their immediate suppliers. Since the Draft EIS, the following changes/corrections have been made to the exploration and development scenarios were delayed to 2008 (at the earliest) to account for the fact that the first sale is in August/September 2007 witl timeframe for exploration activities was spread out over a longer, more realistic time period; the timing of platforms: for cases where production preceded platform installations; and an error in the way that workovers were distributed 0 IMP LAN data became available and were incorporated into MAG-PLAN. In addition, the methodology used to de. MAG-PLAN was enhanced to better account for the fact that some service expenditures will only be made locally du of the sector. For example, purchases that are needed immediately, are not storable, and/or for which there is no ad' because any price savings will not offset the transportation differential. A more detailed description of how local expenditures allocated can be found in the OCS Study MMS 2006-075 (MMS, 2006d). Table IV -7 shows totals of the direct, indirect, and induced employment and labor income for each of the economic the Gulf States, the rest of the Gulf of Mexico, and the rest of the United States. The projections for the economic il 19,800 to 31,640 jobs in an average year attributable to the proposed action (i.e., 11 lease sales). This amounts to regional employment. In Texas, the range is 8,360 to 13,680 jobs. In Louisiana, it is 10,380 to 16,290 jobs. In the ott impacts will be much less. An additional 5,980 to 9,380 jobs are projected to occur in other areas of the Gulf States, ' the rest of the United States.

The additional jobs will create small but noticeable increases in the population of these regions. Using an historically ( new job, we would expect average yearly population increases in the total economic impact area of37,600 to 60,100 c action.

Conclusion
Based on proposed action scenario assumptions, the employment and labor income impact of routine operations woul( Louisiana. Even for the areas most affected, however, added employment demands would not likely unduly burden thl a large proportion of impact sensitive industry, such as tourism, the potential incremental impacts of oil spills would Ii decline in business activity.

As the Nation's principal conservation agency, the Department of the Interior has responsibility for most of our nationally owned public lands and natural resources. This includes fostering sound use of our land and water resources; protecting our fish, wildlife, and biological diversity; preserving the environmental and cultural values of our national parks and historical places; and providing for the enjoyment of life through outdoor recreation . The Department assesses our energy and mineral resources and works to ensure that their development is in the best interests of all our people by encouraging stewardship and citizen participation in their care. The Department also has a major responsibility for American Indian reservation communities and for people who live in island territories under U.S. administration .

The Minerals Management Service Mission
As a bureau of the Department of the Interior, the Minerals Management Service's (MMS) primary responsibilities are to manage the mineral resources located on the Nation's Outer Continental Shelf (DeS) , collect revenue from the Federal DeS and onshore Federal and Indian lands, and distribute those revenues. Moreover, in working to meet its responsibilities, the Offshore Minerals Management Program administers the oes competitive leasing program and oversees the safe and environmentally sound exploration and production of our Nation's offshore natural gas, oil and other mineral resources . The MMS Minerals Revenue Management meets its responsibilities by ensuring the efficient, timely and accurate collection and disbursement of revenue from mineral leasing and production due to Indian tribes and allottees, States and the U.S. Treasury. The MMS strives to fulfill its responsibilities through the general guiding principles of: (1) being responsive to the public's concerns and interests by maintaining a dialogue with all potentially affected parties and (2) carrying out its programs with an emphasis on working to enhance the quality of life for all Americans by lending MMS assistance and expertise to economic development and environmental protection.

Energy Alternatives and the Environment
1. Introduction
This report considers energy alternatives to the proposed action in the Proposed Final Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012 (Proposed Final Program). The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is concerned with energy alternatives for three major reasons: 1. The National Environmental Policy Act requires consideration of a No Action Alternative to the proposed action when preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS). Examining other energy sources is an important aspect of the No Action Alternative for the Proposed Final Program. 2. Those commenting on previous 5-Year Programs have requested consideration of energy alternatives or have suggested that specific energy alternatives are superior to the proposed program. 3. The MMS believes that consideration of alternatives is an important basis for the ultimate decision about the proposed schedule in the Proposed Final Program. The alternatives considered in this report extend beyond the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and even beyond the span of responsibility ofthe Secretary of the Interior. However, the report only considers environmental impacts associated with production and transportation of the alternative sources of energy. This limitation is chosen in order to keep the discussion parallel to that in the Final EIS accompanying the Proposed Final Program. The rationale for this decision is that OCS oil and natural gas are mixed with similar onshore products and become indistinguishable prior to refining, product transport, and final consumption. Any environmental analysis beyond the mixing point would become an analysis of the entire oil and natural gas industry, which is an insupportable expansion ofthe boundary of OCS activities. An exception to this bounding occurs in cases where compliance with environmental regulations affects the cost structure of an energy alternative. In those cases, environmental impacts from consumption of the alternative may be mentioned because those impacts may influence the financial viability of the alternative. Understanding alternatives to oil and natural gas requires an appreciation of the complex nature of these materials. Both oil and natural gas are mixtures of many chemical compounds with different mixtures characterizing different geologic deposits. Crude oil, when processed through an atmospheric distillation column, and natural gas, when processed through a separation plant, break into numerous, identifiable categories of organic chemicals, each with a large number of sub-categories. Natural gas, which is mostly methane, often includes heavier hydrocarbon compounds called ""Natural Gas Liquids"" or ""NGL's."" The majority ofNGL's are stripped from the ""wet"" gas at natural gas processing plants. A subset of the NGL's, propane and butane, which remain gaseous at ambient pressures and temperatures, are also found in crude oil. Under pressure these

substances fonn liquids and are known as liquefied petroleum gases (LPG's). Some of the heavy NGL's, which are liquid at ambient temperatures and pressures and are also found in crude oil, are referred to as ""natural gasoline"" or ""pentanes plus"" and are classified as lease condensate. Despite NGL's association with natural gas production, this report will follow the standard convention that combines NGL data with crude oil data.
An investigation into alternatives to OCS natural gas and oil needs to be built on the following types of information: o the uses of natural gas and oil o the alternatives that can be used to fulfil1 those uses o the circumstances under which alternatives might be adopted o the financial implications and environmental effects of adopting the alternatives

This report is organized around these types of information with emphasis on society'S end uses for products derived from natural gas and oil and the alternatives to those end uses. This approach encourages consideration of a broad range of alternatives. It also opens up the possibility to identify creative solutions to the substitution question. Products made from natural gas and oil permeate virtually every aspect of life in a modem industrial society. The next two sections identify the uses of these products.

2. Uses for Oil and NGL's
Society's end uses for oil and NGL's (referred to as oil for the remainder of this discussion) can be categorized into uses for: o transportation vehicles and as fuel for similar machine engines o industrial heat, steam, and cogeneration o residential and commercial heat, hot water, etc. o electricity generation o non-energy uses Table 1 provides statistics on quantities and percentages of oil-based products used in each energy category or sector. As the table shows, oil provides about 40 percent of our energy on a British thermal unit (Btu) basis. It dominates transportation to such an extent that it can be said that U.S. transportation runs on oil. Oil is an important, but not dominant, source of energy to industry. It makes a modest contribution to the residential and commercial sector and only a minor contribution in electricity generation.

Another way to categorize oil use is by the products into which the oil is refined and then sold. Table 2 shows statistics on sales of major oil refinery products. Gasoline constitutes over 58 percent ofthe total sales volume of oil-based refinery products, jet fuel makes up over 9 percent, and diesel fuel forms a large percentage of the distillate class. It is easy to see that fuels used primarily in transportation constitute most of the volume of refinery products.

2.1. Transportation Vehicles

3

By far the largest and most important use for oil products in the U.S. economy is as transportation fuel. Oil products fuel a majority of vehicles in every major transportation mode.

2.1.1. Gasoline-Powered Vehicles and Engines
The automobile is the dominant icon of the American way of life. In a typical year Americans drive about 2.5 trillion miles and use over 120 billion gallons of gasoline going about their work and play (DOE2000). The flexibility, ease of operation and maintenance, perfonnance, and relatively clean running of gasoline engines make them the choice for the vast majority of automobile owners. In addition to cars, gasoline is used to fuel: o light trucks and buses o small boats o reciprocating engine aircraft o light fann tractors o small engines for many industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential uses

2.1.2. Diesel-Powered Vehicles and Machinery
Diesel engines are the workhorses of the industrial world. Their efficiency and reliability make them the choice for finns and individuals with heavy-duty applications where long-run costs are an important consideration . .In addition to the ubiquitous diesel truck, diesels are used to power: o cars o buses o trains o boats o machinery

2.1.3. Jet Fuel-Powered Aircraft
Almost all large passenger airplanes, most large cargo aircraft, and many smaller planes and helicopters are powered by jet engines or use turbo jets for their propulsion. Jet airplanes are almost always faster than their propeller-driven counterparts and turboprop planes and helicopters are usually faster than reciprocating engine models. Because much of the point of flight is to travel faster, jet planes dominate the most important niches in the aviation industry. Jet fuel lies between gasoline and diesel fuel in volatility. It comes in 2 grades; however, well over 90 percent of jet fuel sold in the U.S. is of the kerosene type.

2.1.4. Steam-Powered Ships
Ships generally use relatively crude steam boilers for their power. Virtually any combustible material can power these boilers although virtually all modem ships use oil-based products for their fuel. In the recent past, ships used some of the lowest grades of residual fuel oil and the heaviest distillates. More recently, air pollution restrictions while ships are in port have led shipping companies to switch to less polluting medium distillates.

2. 1.5. Propane-Powered Industrial and Commercial Vehicles
Industrial and commercial establishments employ LPG's (usually referred to as ""propane"") powered vehicles and machinery, such as forklifts, primarily for off-road applications, because of the generally lower maintenance costs associated with this fuel and the better performance compared to similar electric machinery. Even though LPG is primarily used in off-road applications, LPG-powered vehicles constitute an important class of alternative-fueled vehicles on United States highways (EIA 1999).

2.2. Industrial Sector Uses
Next to the transportation sector, industry uses more oil products than other sectors. However, oil provides less than a third of industrial energy. This percentage has been relatively stable for many years.

2.2.1. Industrial Process Heat and Steam
Heat and steam perform a vast array of tasks for industry from melting metals to driving chemical processes to aiding the bonding of materials. Oil competes with other energy sources for this role and usually wins out in situations where coal produces unacceptable levels of air pollution, natural gas is unavailable in adequate quantities, or capital equipment was originally designed for oil and replacement is too expensive. Steam still powers some machinery, but either electric motors or diesel engines (which were covered along with diesel transportation equipment) now power most machines.

2.2.2. Air Conditioning and Drying
Air conditioning includes both heating and cooling. Oil products are used not only for raising the comfort level of industrial buildings, but also to create the right air temperature and humidity conditions to maximize the effectiveness of various processes or to minimize maintenance costs. Drying is a response to the many industrial processes involving wet materials. Oil successfully competes for industrial air conditioning and drying in many of the same situations as for industrial process heat and steam.

5

2.2.3. Cogeneration
Cogeneration is the process of using excess or exhaust steam from an industrial process for generating electricity or vice versa. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURP A) requires electric utilities to purchase available power from willing sellers at reasonable prices. Since the passage of PURP A, a large percentage of the potentially viable cogeneration sites have gone into service. Cogeneration now constitutes almost ten percent of US. electricity generation and the Department of Energy expects cogeneration to maintain this percentage in the future (EIA 1996b).

2.3. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
The residential and commercial sectors use products made from oil for air conditioning (primarily heating), heating water, and running appliances (in locations not served by electricity). Natural gas and electricity dominate these sectors. Oil products compete best where natural gas is unavailable and the climate is sufficiently cold that electric heat pumps are inefficient. A broad range of oil products serves the residential and commercial sectors from LPG (propane) through kerosene to fuel oil. Choice depends mostly on local availability and already-installed equipment.

2.4. Electricity Generation
2.4. 1. Steam Boilers
Most electricity is generated by heating water to the boiling point and directing the expanded volume of steam through a turbine. The rotating shaft of the turbine connects to the shaft of a generator that produces electricity. Virtually any fuel can be used to fire the steam boilers. Until very recently, oil-based products, even relatively cheap residual fuel, had been more expensive per kilowatt of electricity produced than other fuels such as natural gas and coal. Recently, gas prices reached or exceeded the prices per unit of energy of oil-based fuels. Oil-fired steam boilers tend to be used in situations where conversion to natural gas is impractical due to unavailability of gas or where it would be too expensive to convert.

2.4.2. Diesel Generators
Diesel engines can also be used to tum the shaft of a generator to produce electricity. Diesels are usually only used in remote sites where the electricity demand is too small to justify the expense of installing a steam boiler and transportation of diesel fuel is relatively inexpensive.

2.5. Non-Energy Uses
2.5.1. Chemical Feedstock
The chemical industry converts NGL's and oil refinery products into a vast array of goods for industry and final consumers. Plastics, artificial fibers, paints and preservatives, agricultural chemicals, and many pharmaceuticals are all made primarily from NGL's and oil refinery 6

products. Although our economy consumes large quantities of these products, the amount of oil going into them is much less than that which goes into energy applications, especially transportation.

2.5.2. Solvents, Lubricants, Asphalts, and Waxes
Several other groups of chemicals are made from oil and LPG's but retain much of their original characteristics even after chemical conversion. These are solvents, lubricants, asphalts, and waxes. The properties of the various types of LPG and oil used in these products are enhanced in the chemical conversion process but retain much of their original nature.

3. Uses for Natural Gas
As table 3 shows, the industrial, residential, and commercial sectors are the largest consumers of natural gas. Electricity generation uses less gas than the preceding sectors; however, it is the fastest growing major use of natural gas. The figure shown for transportation refers only to the use of natural gas in pipeline transportation.

3.1. Industrial Sector Uses
On a Btu basis, the percentage of energy industry derives from natural gas surpassed oil-derived products in 1987 making it the largest source of energy for this sector. However, in 200 1 natural gas fell behind oil in response to the relative rise in natural gas prices on a Btu basis. Natural gas maintains an important position as a source of industrial energy for two major reasons: 1. Burning natural gas produces less air pollution, including greenhouse gases, than any other fossil fuel. This allows industry to use natural gas burning technology without expensive pollution control equipment that might be required for other energy sources. 2. The cleaner burning and handling character of natural gas tends to keep maintenance costs
7

low. Further adoption of natural gas is limited by relatively high prices, the unavailability of secure supplies, and by equipment designed for other energy sources which has not yet reached the replacement point. Industry uses natural gas for the same purposes as it uses oil-based fuels: o industrial process heat and steam o air conditioning and drying o cogeneration These industrial processes use much the same technology for both natural gas and oil-based fuels. Differences derive mostly from the gaseous nature of natural gas versus the liquid nature of most oil-based products. Of special note is that a majority of United States cogeneration is fueled with natural gas.

3.2. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
Natural gas performs much the same role in the residential and commercial sectors as oil: to condition air (primarily to heat it), to heat water, and to run appliances in locations not served by electricity. Natural gas and electricity dominate these sectors. The residential and commercial sectors favor natural gas because of its low cost and low maintenance. Recent relative price increases and lack of access or the expense of access to gas pipelines limits the further penetration of natural gas into these sectors.

3.3. Electricity Generation
The natural gas industry considers electricity generation to be its growth sector. In recent years electric utilities have been slow to add new generating capacity. However, rapidly increasing electricity demand, most notably in California, has forced electric utilities to consider adding significantly to their generating capacity. Natural gas will fire most new power plants under construction and probably those in the planning stages as well.

3.3.1. Turbines
Much new and planned electricity generating capacity consists of gas turbines. Gas turbines operate by directing the hot gases from burning natural gas into a turbine. As in a steam boiler, the rotating shaft of the turbine connects to the shaft of a generator that produces electricity. Electric utilities have to deal with vast swings in the demand for their power. So-called peaks in demand occur on summer afternoons when air conditioning reaches its maximum and on winter evenings when electric ranges and other appliances add their draw to heating. Peaking power is the most expensive power for utilities to produce. Gas turbines, because of their very rapid fireup capability, along with hydroelectric and pump storage capacity, constitute the equipment of choice for peaking. In addition, their low initial capital cost, relatively low maintenance, and efficiency make gas turbines highly competitive with coal-fired plants, which require expensive pollution control
8

technology.
3.3.2. Steam Boilers

Gas-fired steam boilers are very similar to oil-fired models; indeed, some boilers are designed to use either fuel with only minor adjustments. Most duel-fuel boilers and most boilers that can be inexpensively converted to gas already use gas because of its reduced air pollution and less expensive maintenance.
3.3.3. Combined Cycle

Combined cycle plants first use natural gas to fire gas turbines, then they use the hot gases from the turbine exhaust to create steam which is used to generate electricity in the same way as in normal cycle steam generation. The cost of electricity generated using combined cycle technology compares favorably with that produced using other fuels in conventional plants. The possibility also exists to use the hot water remaining when the steam condenses in a cogeneration mode.

3.4. Transportation
The 2004 transportation sector consumption of natural gas reported in table 3 consists entirely of gas used to power the pumps and other machinery that moves natural gas across the country via pipelines. Any natural gas used in motor vehicles is reported in the residential and commercial sector because almost all the natural gas vehicles in service in the United States are fleet vehicles operated by commercial establishments. Vehicular use of natural gas is growing rapidly (see table 6). Nevertheless, natural gas accounts for only a small percentage of the highway fuel used in the United States.

3.5. Non-Energy Uses
Natural gas, primarily methane, is also used as a chemical feedstock. Among the products made from natural gas are chemicals like methanol, ammonia, and formaldehyde that are converted into final products like fertilizer, detergents, and glues.

4. The No Action Alternative
The National Environmental Policy Act requires consideration of a No Action Alternative to every major Federal action significantly affecting the environment. In the case of the Proposed Final Program, no action means that the MMS would hold no OCS oil and gas lease sales during the 5-year period covered by the Program. An absence of lease sales means production firms do not obtain rights to new oil and natural gas resources on the OCS. As a result, the oil and natural gas that would have been produced as a consequence of sales over that 5-year period would not be available to consumers. This section reports the results of an investigation into the most likely response of oil and natural gas markets to a curtailment of their supplies from the OCS and the ensuing environmental

9

impacts. Under these assumptions, markets would have to respond to a reduction in supply equal to the anticipated production from the 5-Year Program. Note that in a typical year almost twothirds of oes production on a Btu basis has consisted of natural gas (MMS 2001). The other one-third or so has been oil and NGL's. Recently, the percentage of oil has been increasing and in the near future oes oil production is projected to surpass gas on a Btu basis (Farndon 2006).

4.1.

Methodology

The MMS employs the MarketSim model to evaluate the impact of decreased oes production resulting from no action. MarketSim estimates changes in quantities of alternatives to oes natural gas and oil traded in domestic markets. This same model, which includes oil and gas submodels, also performs other analyses used in the development of the 5-Year Program. A more detailed description of the market simulation model can be found in a companion paper to this one (King 2007).

4.2. Market Response to a Reduction in OCS Production
The MMS ran MarketSim for low and high cases chosen to bracket the most likely range of future conditions. The purpose of these runs was to demonstrate the response of oil and gas markets to a reduction in oes production under a variety of circumstances. The MMS has chosen to base its analysis on an oil price of $46 per barrel (bbl) and a natural gas wellhead price of $6.96 per mcf. While these prices are somewhat below recent open market prices, they are thought to represent a realistic estimate of the kind oflong-term prices the oil and gas industry will be using for making its development decisions.

4.2.1. Results for Oil
Table 4 shows the most important results of runs comparing the Proposed Program to no action under the low and high cases. The percentage estimates, which are almost identical for the low and high cases, are the most interesting and useful numbers in the table. They imply that for each hundred barrels of oes oil not produced: o onshore U.S. oil production will increase by about 3 barrels o U.S. oil imports will increase by about 88 barrels o conservation will account for a decline in U.S. oil consumption of about 5 barrels o switching to gas will amount to the equivalent of about 4 barrels In absolute terms expectations are for: o onshore production to make up 200 million of the 5.7 billion barrels lost through no action at the low price and 300 million of the 12.1 billion barrels ofOeS production lost at the high price o imports to account for 5.1 billion barrels at the low price and 10.7 billion barrels at the high price

conservation to total the equivalent of 300 million barrels at the low price and 600 million at the high price switching to gas the equivalent of 200 million barrels at the low price and 500 million at the high price (MarketSim deals with the oil and gas markets in isolation. In reality, if OCS production were curtailed, less OCS gas would lead to more imported oil, conservation, and domestic onshore oil and gas production than the model shows.)

All these amounts would substitute for the 5.7 billion barrels of oil lost through no action at the low price and 12.1 billion barrels at the high price. The distribution of conservation and switching to gas by sector depends on the amount of consumption in each sector and the price elasticities of demand in each sector. Transportation accounted for 68 percent and industrial consumption 24 percent of U.S. oil use in 2004. Residential and commercial consumption accounted for about 6 percent (EIA 2006). Other forms of energy cannot readily substitute for most of this oil in the near term. In the U.S. transportation sector, a consumption decline would probably involve a reduction in miles traveled, the purchase of more fuel-efficient cars, or both. Most energy projections show relatively little alternative fuel, such as ethanol, entering the transportation sector for many years (EIA 2001 b). However, ethanol consumption in the transportation sector increased 350 percent from 1996 to 2005 (EIA 2006). Significant additional fuel substitution in response to the relatively small price increase implied by the model would be unlikely. In addition to the 11

modest price increase associated with these scenarios, the costs of replacing the present transportation fuel infrastructure further hinders efforts to extend the use of alternative transportation fuels. In the industrial sector most uses for which there exists a ready substitute for oil have already converted to the substitute. Many industrial uses such as for products like asphalt and lube oils have few comparable substitutes. Oil use in the residential and commercial sectors is forecast to occur principally at locations without access to natural gas, so little fuel substitution can be expected. The only applications where significant substitution is likely are industrial heat and steam and electricity generation. The degree of substitution in these sectors depends on whether oil is competing directly with gas for market share. In the recent past, natural gas and oil did not compete in the boiler market because gas was significantly cheaper. Recently, as gas prices rose past the level of oil prices in these sectors, only a modest amount of fuel switching took place. Because of gas's greater efficiency and environmental superiority, only moderate switching will likely occur unless gas prices rise significantly higher than oil.

4.2.2. Results for Natural Gas
Table 4 also reveals that for each thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of OCS gas not produced because of no action, MMS anticipates the following results: o U.S. onshore gas production will increase by 0.28 Mcf o imports will increase by 0.16 Mcf o conservation will account for about 0.16 Mcf o switching to oil will amount to the equivalent of about 0.39 or 0.40 Mcf In absolute terms in the low case this amounts to: o 5.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of onshore gas o 3.3 Tcf of gas imports (mostly from Canada) o conservation equivalent to 3.4 Tcf of gas o switching to oil equivalent to 8.2 Tcf of gas substituting for the 20.7 Tcf of OCS natural gas lost through no action. In absolute terms in the high case this amounts to: o 10.3 Tcf of onshore gas o 5.9 Tcf of gas imports (mostly from Canada) o conservation equivalent to 5.9 Tcf of gas o switching to oil equivalent to 14.3 Tcf of gas substituting for the 36.4 trillion cubic feet of OCS natural gas lost through no action. Of the reduced consumption of natural gas in the low case, the equivalent of about 8.2 Tcf of gas would consist of switching to oil. This means that an additional 1.5 billion barrels of oil would clear the market. Assuming that imports constitute 88 percent of any additional oil traded in the U.S. market, this adds another 1.3 billion barrels of oil to imports. Thus, as a result of no action, 12

an additional 6.4 billion barrels of oil would have to be imported by the U.S. The corresponding import estimate for the high case is 12.9 billion barrels of oil.

4.3. Environmental Impacts from the Market Response to a Reduction in DeS Production
4.3.1. Onshore Oil and Gas Production
Onshore oil and gas are often produced together from the same wells; furthermore, the impacts from efforts to recover the two resources are almost identical even in those cases where production from a given location is entirely oil or entirely gas. Onshore oil and gas production has notable negative impacts on surface water, groundwater, and wildlife. Onshore oil and gas production can also be expected to cause negative impacts on soils, air pollution, vegetation, noise, and odor. Surface water could incur increased turbidity, salinity, and sedimentation caused by runoff from road, drilling pad, and pipeline construction. Other sources of water pollution include discharges of drilling muds, other toxic chemicals, and engine fuels and lubricants. Although holding ponds or reserve pits for produced waters and other process waste are required to retain any environmentally hazardous substances, spills of such materials into surface waters are a risk. Groundwater can be contaminated from puncture of the aquifer or from leaching down from improperly sealed surface holding ponds or overflow of those ponds onto permeable surfaces. In many areas, sufficient interchange occurs between surface and groundwater sources that pollution of one leads to the contamination of the other. For the most part, surface disturbance from oil and gas development is sufficiently limited that it causes relatively minor negative impacts on wildlife. A large portion of the negative impact on wildlife comes through water pollution and the impacts on wildlife living in or drinking from a water supply contaminated by oil and gas extraction activities. However, holding ponds can pose a significant threat to birds, especially waterfowl. Improperly safeguarded holding ponds can prove attractive to waterfowl and other birds looking for a safe resting and feeding location. Birds landing on these ponds may drown when the action of solvents in the pond material destroys the buoyancy of their feathers. Soil and vegetative disturbance is mostly a result of construction activities. However, soils can become contaminated and vegetation killed by spills of herbicidal chemicals. Diesel engines employed in construction, drilling, and production contribute to air and noise pollution. Chemicals used in drilling and production can create noxious odors. Local standards may partially control these impacts, but oil and gas production adds to the cumulative burden of these pollutants.

4.3.2. Imports
Environmental impacts associated with expanded importation of oil include: o generation of greenhouse gases and regulated air pollutants from both transport and

Air pollution and oil spills vie for the dubious distinction of being the most important of these classes of impact. Oil spills are certainly the negative events most people associate with oil importation. Table 5 shows by region the estimated additional spills greater than 1000 barrels associated with the no action alternative, along with their probabilities.

The environmental impacts from oil spills are well documented in the EIS for the 5-Year Program. Tanker spills tend to be larger events than those from OCS pipelines. While it is uncertain where the spills associated with additional imports will occur, the majority of tanker spills occur in port or near shore where the potential environmental impact is more severe. 14

This report does not address environmental impacts outside the United States. In the case of imported oil, negative environmental impacts in producing countries and in countries along trade routes can be significant, especially where environmental protection standards are lower than those in the U. S.

4.3.3. Conservation
As shown in table 4, the price increase induced by the no action alternative will lead people to conserve about 6 percent of expected oil consumption and 16 percent of expected natural gas consumption. This conservation is composed of two major components: o substituting energy saving technology, often embodied in new capital equipment, for energy resources (for example, adding to home insulation) o consuming less of an energy using service (for example, turning down the thermostat in an office during the winter) This paper discusses the environmental impacts from oil and gas conservation in sections 6 and 7, respectively.

4.3.4. Fuel Switching
Table 4 shows people switching 4 percent of their consumption from oil to gas and 40 percent from gas to oil. This seemingly anomalous result is a function of the two submodels used to estimate the oil and gas market responses. To keep the analysis simple, the two submodels account for the price change in their market in isolation from the other market. In reality, there would probably be no switching from oil to gas. Because it is much easier to increase oil imports than gas imports, the price of gas would rise relative to the price of oil and people would switch to oil. This would shift the demand for oil at the same time the supply was being restricted. The major source to satisfy this increased demand would be imports that would add to the imports induced by the initial oil supply decrease.

5. Government Imposition of Energy Alternatives
In the U.S. economy, market forces make most decisions about the allocation of resources. However, government sometimes chooses to override market decisions in order to change the economy's energy mix. This section will investigate specific forms of energy government might choose as substitutes for OCS natural gas and oil and some ofthe consequences of those choices. Even if leasing on the OCS proceeds, government can choose policies having the effect of imposing various energy alternatives on society. These policies may be chosen to: o minimize reliance on imports, such as oil, from unstable regions o encourage the use of a politically favored fuel, such as ethanol o reduce air pollution, such as by mandating electric vehicles conserve energy

o

Among the policy tools government can use to encourage or force the adoption of a desired

15

energy o o o

mIX are: taxes subsidies perfonnance standards

5.1. Taxes to Achieve a Desired Energy Mix
Government can impose either broad-based or narrowly focused energy taxes. A broad-based energy tax would tax all or a broad spectrum of energy alternatives. An example, which has been discussed at considerable length, is the carbon tax. The carbon tax would impose a levy on all hydrocarbon materials used as sources of energy in proportion to the amount of carbon the material contains. The carbon tax is aimed at controlling the sources of greenhouse gases that have been found to contribute to global warming. The increased cost of fuels containing carbon would encourage consumers to switch to non-carbon sources of energy such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, and nuclear. It would also encourage conservation both through the substitution of capital for energy and through reduced use. Narrowly focused energy taxes include the taxes imposed by national and state governments on vehicle fuels. These fuel taxes have the primary purpose of raising money to pay for highway, road, and bridge construction and maintenance. Theoretically, they also have the effect of discouraging people from using automobile transportation and substituting trains, planes, or buses. By their nature taxes distort market signals in the economy. In the case of energy taxes, they impose a direct cost on energy consumers and producers (who suffer a loss of profits).

5.2. Subsidies for Energy Alternatives
Many governments subsidize favored energy sources, actions usually justified as a temporary aid to start an infant industry. Recent examples in the U.S. are tax rebates for ethanol used as a gasoline additive and the subsidy extended to coal bed methane extraction for addition to the natural gas system. Subsidies that reward production of an energy product serve to reduce that product's unit costs and thuslower the supply curve for the product leading to increased use and enhanced profits for producers. Subsidies can also take the form of grants to consumers. Home heating subsidies for the poor in the U.S. are an example of this approach. Consumer energy subsidies tend to raise the effective demand curves for the fuels involved leading to greater sales and profits. This type of subsidy tends to apply to a range of different energy sources capable of performing the function being supported, such as heating homes in winter. Although home heating subsidies tend to increase fuel use, subsidies for things like insulation and weatherization are sometimes used to encourage fuel conservation. On the cost side, taxpayers must pay for the subsidies, further distorting market signals. In addition, unintended consequences may result from imperfect govenunent decisions.

16

5.3. Energy Performance Standards and Regulations
Energy perfonnance standards and the regulations developed to implement them are one of the cornerstones of US. energy policy. The best known set of energy perfonnance standards are the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standards that set the average fleet vehicle miles per gallon of gasoline that each automobile manufacturer must meet with the set (fleet) of vehicles the manufacturer produces in a year.

6. Alternatives to Oil and NGL's and Their Environmental Impacts
Primary alternatives to OCS oil are imported oil and oil from onshore production. In addition to these primary alternatives, other materials and fonns of energy can be substituted for oil to provide the services consumers demand. However, only five basic ways exist to replace the oil society decides not to obtain from the OCS: import, produce onshore, switch fuel, substitute oil saving technology, or accept less service. The total number of specific alternatives fitting within these broad categories appears almost endless. Nevertheless, the basic approaches to replacement are limited. The same point holds true for natural gas. Importation and onshore production are covered in section 4.3. This section will review the other potential substitutes for OCS oil. The discussion will cover the potential future market and the environmental impacts from the production and transportation of the original energy resource for each specific energy alternative.

6.1. Transportation Vehicle Fuel
Table 1 shows the transportation sector to be by far the largest user of oil and oil products being the overwhelmingly dominant transportation fuels in the US. economy. Thus, the transportation sector is the first place to look for ways to replace oil. In the words of the 1991 National Energy Strategy (DOE 1991), ""The transportation sector offers the best available opportunity to reduce US. dependence on oil, improve the quality of air in metropolitan areas, and spur the development and use of new, more efficient, environmentally superior vehicle and fuel technology."" Oil can be replaced by switching to other fuels, adopting more efficient vehicles, implementing more efficient transportation systems, and accepting less motorized transportation. The latter three of these alternatives are examples of conservation.

6. 1. 1. Alternative Fuels
Table 6 lists the consumption of alternative fuels and the number of alternative-fueled vehicles in the United States for 2000 estimated by the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA 2000). LPG powers more of these vehicles than any other alternative fuel. This is an oil product so it is not relevant to this discussion. Clearly the most popular non-oil-based alternative fuels are compressed natural gas and ethanol. Other fuels may have future potential, but none is a viable presence yet.

6.1.1.1. Natural Gas
Two forms of natural gas can be utilized as transportation vehicle fuel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The use of LNG is limited to a few heavy-duty trucks and, primarily, passenger buses in three large programs (Houston, Seattle, and Los Angeles). The CNG's easier and cheaper conversion and handling give it the lead in current applications to 18

transportation. The recent growth in the number of CNG vehicles has greatly exceeded that of all other types of alternative fuels. Montgomery and Sweeney (1991) explain this growth, ""Compressed natural gas is now the alternative fuel with the lowest net cost, considering all factors, and appears to be finding its way into the market under current policies. Its role may be greatest in fleet operations, especially those involving large vehicles, where central refueling and some loss in vehicle space is not important, and where the low cost of natural gas fuel is important. "" EIA (1996) adds that other factors promoting the growth ofCNG are ""support from natural gas utilities, relatively greater availability of vehicles and fuels compared to most other alternative fuels, and continued public and private sector enthusiasm for the fuel."" The technical problems with CNG fuel cylinders have apparently been solved. Furthermore, some cities, like New York and Washington, DC, are turning to natural gas to power their urban buses as a method of reducing air pollution (Layton 2000). The natural gas to be utilized as a transportation fuel in the form of CNG can be supplied from OCS, domestic onshore, pipeline imports from Canada, or imported LNG sources. Environmental impacts from domestic OCS production are covered in the 5-Year EIS. Domestic onshore production is covered in section 4.3.1. of this paper. Additional pipeline imports from Canada would require additional pipelines. Associated construction would lead to temporary increases in water pollution from unstable construction sites and spills of construction-related fuels and other chemicals. LNG imports experienced a record high of 507 Bcfin 2003. Although that only amounts to 2.7 percent of U.S. consumption and 13 percent of imports, this form of importation is expected to rise dramatically. As of2004 applications had been filed or pre filed for 19 new LNG terminals to join the four already in operation. Five of the filings were for offshore LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. The increased interest in LNG is driven by new technology making the method more efficient, the growth in LNG export terminals throughout the world, and the price advantage of foreign natural gas over increasingly expensive domestic sources. The LNG imports introduce a new form of environmental impact. In addition to the risk of fuel spills from LNG ships, there is a slight risk of an LNG leak. Because it is super cold, as LNG vaporizes, the cold vapors gather close to the ground where they smother any animal inhabitants. If a large quantity of the vapors could be ignited, they would produce a violent explosion. Fortunately, the risk of such an occurrence is very low. 6.1.1.2. Methanol Two forms of methanol find application as transportation fuels: M85, which is 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline, and MI00, which is pure (neat) methanol. Apparently, M100 use has peaked. Because of the poor performance and maintenance record it has compiled, little additional MI00 use is expected in the future (EIA 2000). 19

Adoption ofM85 as a transportation fuel seems to be governed by the cost of methanol. Four variables go into the price of methanol as a transportation fuel: 1) the price of natural gas because virtually all commercial methanol is made from natural gas, 2) the cost of building the very large conversion plants needed to capture economies of scale, 3) the cost of developing the necessary new distribution system, and 4) the demand for methanol for other purposes. Methanol is a raw material in the creation of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a major constituent of refonnulated gasoline. Recent demand for reformulated gasoline has driven up the price of methanol and it is still uncertain where the price will eventually settle. Nevertheless, the use ofM85 has declined from its high in the late 1990's. There remains a question about whether M85 will ever find a larger niche in the transportation sector. Conversion of gasoline and diesel powered vehicles to methanol is relatively inexpensive; however, dual powered vehicles capable of using either gasoline and methanol or diesel and methanol seem to encounter technical problems. The process of conversion from gasoline to methanol entails the development of a new fuel distribution network. The implication of this requirement is that a major conversion effort must be launched to make this alternative viable. However, the effort need not be nationwide. A regional market, if it were large enough and well enough defined, could be converted without involving the rest of the nation. Because most commercially available methanol is made from natural gas, the extraction step in the process has been covered in the 5-Year Program EIS and section 4.3. of this paper. Production of methanol from natural gas, depending on the precise technology used, may lead to additional discharges of atmospheric pollutants with resultant impacts on local air quality, acid rain, stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, and greenhouse gasses. The production process may also lead to discharges of contaminated and heated water into streams, rivers, and lakes.

6. 1. 1.3. Ethanol
In addition to its use as a gasoline additive, two different forms of ethanol are potential alternative fuels. E95 is 95 percent ethanol and 5 percent gasoline. Like Ml 00, users are showing little interest in E95 . E85 consists of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. Through 1995 users have shown only modest interest in E85 vehicles. However, beginning in 1997, Chevrolet S-1 0 and GMC Sonoma pickup trucks produced by General Motors have been . flexible fuel vehicles that can use either gasoline or E85 (EIA 2000). More recently, General Motors has expanded the list of flexible fuel vehicles it manufactures. The principal problem with ethanol is its high cost. Present interest undoubtedly stems from subsidies in the fonn of exemptions from Federal and some state excise taxes. Because ethanol is corrosive and an absorbent of water, it cannot be transported through conventional pipelines. These characteristics make it incompatible with present liquid fuel distribution systems. A viable, large-scale ethanol industry requires a new infrastructure including new transportation, storage, and dispensing equipment. Distillers produce ethanol through the fermentation of a sugar-containing biological product. Corn is the feedstock most widely used for ethanol production in North America. Research into 20

the use of cellulose as a feedstock for ethanol production has opened up the possibility of using wood fiber, grasses, and other woody vegetation as a cheap raw material (Lovins 2006). Farmers may grow additional com needed to meet expanded ethanol demand principally on land now considered marginal for crop production. They will have to remove land from less intense uses to devote to this intensively cultivated row crop. This action will result in significant increases in soil erosion, fertilizer runoff, and systemic effects through expanded uses of pesticides and herbicides. The net effect will be deteriorated water quality through siltation, eutrophication, and chemical toxicity. Upland wildlife habitat will be diminished through loss of cover and the effects of chemical toxicity. Wildlife will also be adversely affected by the additional rural activity associated with the more intense agriculture. Production of ethanol uses great quantities of water and leads to releases of large quantities of oxygen depleting materials into streams and rivers. The net effect is significant further deterioration of water quality. Ethanol production also has deleterious impacts on local air quality through hydrocarbon releases and on greenhouse gases through copious CO 2 releases.

6.1.1.4. Electricity
The future of electric vehicles is dominated by state mandates for zero emission vehicles (ZEV's). Starting in 1998, California, New York, and Massachusetts require that 2 percent of the vehicles sold in the state be ZEV's. The requirement increases incrementally to 10 percent in 2003 (EIA 1996). Electric vehicles are the only ones that have zero emissions (at the point of use). Electric vehicles suffer from some performance problems; however, the ultimate limitations on electric vehicle acceptance revolve around technical problems with batteries. Batteries are too heavy, take too long to recharge, do not hold sufficient charge, and (most important) are much too expensive. Until these problems are solved, or at least ameliorated, consumers are unlikely to freely choose electric vehicles over vehicles powered with internal combustion engines or hybrids. The only way to overcome this rejection would be to induce consumers to take electric vehicles or to do as the three states above are and force the automobile companies to offer consumers incentives.

If the battery technology problems are overcome, or if ZEV mandates are effective, the substantial adoption of electric vehicles will greatly increase the demand for electricity. Meeting increased demand for electricity will lead to the kinds of environmental impacts noted in section 7.1, which deals with electricity generation.
6.1.1.5. Hydrogen
Hydrogen powered fuel cells could be used in a new generation of vehicles designed to minimize final use air pollution in urban areas. One article put it this way, ""One day, many experts believe, the auto industry could virtually wean itself completely from fossil fuels with so-called fuel cells that use hydrogen. But that day is at least 20 years away (BusinessWeek 2001)."" Hydrogen fuel cell technology faces three major impediments: 21

o o o

hydrogen production using present technology is expensive-requiring large amounts of electricity no distribution network exists hydrogen is relatively hard to transport over long distances

If the U.S. Government decided to pursue hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on a large scale, we would have to develop major additions to the electricity production infrastructure. The impacts of this development are discussed in the section on electricity generation (7.1). Research on the use of enzymes found in organisms growing in extreme conditions has found a way to produce hydrogen from glucose and presumably other sugars and similar materials including perhaps even cellulose. If this approach proves to be financially feasible, it may become a major source of energy for the future. It will be decades before this technology is implemented on a broad scale. Nevertheless, hydrogen powered fuel cells have the potential to eventually replace the internal combustion engine as the primary transportation engine. The resulting ""hydrogen economy"" could revolutionize the world fuel mix (EREN 2001). MMS is studying the potential for hydrogen production as a means of transporting energy produced from advanced technologies on the oes.

6.1.2 More Efficient Vehicles
One good way to conserve energy, or in this case to substitute for OCS oil, is to adopt more efficient transportation vehicles. Essentially this can be accomplished either by improving the efficiency of engines and transmissions or by adopting lighter and more streamlined vehicle bodies. Government interference in the market place often leadsto unintended consequences. Potentially, that could be the case with more fuel-efficient vehicles and other government energy programs. For instance, more fuel-efficient cars might encourage car owners to drive more. This would partially negate any fuel savings. In addition, greater automobile efficiency might discourage use of even more efficient alternative modes of transportation such as mass transit or ride sharing. Nevertheless, more efficient vehicles are likely to be a highly effective way to decrease the aggregate demand for oil in the transportation sector.

6.1.2.1. Improved Engines and Transmissions
Automobile manufacturers have responded to the CAFE standards by steadily increasing the fuel economy of cars sold in the United States market. Major contributors to this increased efficiency have been more efficient engines and transmissions. Although more efficient engines and transmissions presumably bum gasoline for fuel, the potential exists for this alternative to decrease further the amount of oil consumed in automobile transportation. The problem with this alternative is that it increases the cost of new automobiles. No negative environmental consequences stem from this alternative. This desirable outcome is undoubtedly the basis for the current Government-private industry partnership to produce a more fuel-efficient automobile. Several auto makers have introduced hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles in the American market. These automobiles use small, efficient gasoline engines for cruising. While the cars are cruising or braking, they charge specially designed batteries attached to highly efficient and powerful electric motors. The electric motors take control when needed for extra power and during stop 22

and go driving while the gasoline engine waits in reserve until it is needed when the batteries run down or for sustained high speed driving. Virtually all hybrid vehicles qualify as ultra-efficient vehicles. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than gasoline engines for any particular application. Diesel engines dominate markets for trucks, buses, and trains. Consumers resist diesel engines in cars because: o their performance characteristics are poorer than gasoline engines o they are more expensive o they are harder to start o older models were smelly and smoky and the perception persists o diesel fuel is less widely available than gasoline However, if car companies choose to market the cleaner burning diesel engines currently popular in Europe and consumers can be convinced to accept them, diesels could effect a major decline in oil use. Diesel hybrids could be even more efficient.

6.1.2.2. Lighter, More Streamlined Vehicle Bodies
Vehicles with lighter, more streamlined bodies would also save additional fuel. Manufacturers have made significant progress in this direction, but more is still possible. One study reached the conclusion that decreasing the weight of automobiles would result in about two-thirds of the potential increase in fuel efficiency that could be expected using state-of-the-art design (Lovins 2006). Increasing the proportions of aluminum and plastic composites could reduce vehicle weights. Lightweight steel can be almost as light and cheaper than the other alternatives. Lighter weight vehicles have several problems: o they are more expensive o they are thought to be less safe o they may be more expensive to repair in case of collision damage o they may be less acceptable to buyers looking for a ""solid"" steel car or truck More streamlined cars may be less acceptable because buyers find the style of such cars too extreme for their taste. More streamlined bodies should have few negative environmental consequences. Environmental consequences of lighter bodies would depend on the materials of which they are made. Plastic composites usually use oil as a raw material so the amount of oil embodied in the construction of lighter vehicles based on plastic is likely to increase. However, the life cycle oil use of the lighter vehicles is likely to decrease. Similarly, aluminum requires more energy to produce than the amount of steel needed to perform the same function; nevertheless, life cycle oil savings are likely to accrue to an increase in the proportion of aluminum.

6.1.3. More Efficient Transportation Systems
The United States has the least energy efficient transportation system among the major industrialized countries. Improving the efficiency of this system would reduce the single largest source of oil demand in our economy. Among the possible approaches for achieving this end are:
23

o o o

using more mass transit and car pools increasing the percentage of rail transport designing and building more efficient road systems

6.1.3.1. More Mass Transit and Car Pools
A large portion of automobile use is for commuting to and from work. A large percentage of workers commute alone in their automobiles. Enticing commuters to use mass transit and car pools on a large scale would save vast quantities of oil. Although such a switch in transportation mode should save money for commuters, a majority are unwilling to make the switch because they like the freedom and convenience afforded by driving one's own car. The environmental consequences of switching to mass transit and car pools would be entirely positive. Air, water, land, noise, and visual aesthetics would all be improved.

6.1.3.2. Greater Use of Rail Transportation
Trains are more energy efficient than trucks, buses, cars, or planes. Increasing the portion of goods and passengers traveling by rail would save oil. Train travel is avoided because it tends to be slower, door-to-door, than the other modes listed and it often entails mode changes to reach destinations not served by railroad lines. Increased rail travel would tend to have positive environmental consequences although there could be negative impacts from construction ifrail transportation became sufficiently popular to require additional rail lines. However, net impacts to air, water, land, and noise would all decline.

6.1.3.3. Improved Road Systems
Road systems can be designed to handle the same volume of traffic more efficiently. Adequate road space to handle peak loads at normal speeds is one way to do this. Timing traffic lights and installing more ""smart"" traffic lights to keep high volume traffic moving are others. Building more free flowing highways is a third way to increase efficiency. Unfortunately, these alternatives tend to be expensive and to lead to higher use by motorists abandoning mass transit for the freedom and speed of individual commuting. The environmental consequences of more efficient roads depend on the impacts of construction and the space usurped by increasing the land area devoted to roads.

6.1.4. Less Motorized Transportation
Another way to save oil currently going into motorized transportation is to do less of it. People would tend to use less transportation if its price increased. Taxes could be used to decrease transportation use. Given the unpopularity of increasing taxes, it is unlikely that this alternative will be used to any great extent. Other approaches to less motorized transportation include telecommuting and non-motorized vehicles.

6.1.4.1. Telecommuting
Allowing workers to use computers and to perform other work-related activities in their homes saves the oil that would be used in commuting. Telecommuting is limited by:
24

o o o

work unsuited to the home environment difficulty supervising workers interruptions from other family members

Negative environmental consequences of telecommuting are virtually nonexistent.

6.1.4.2. Non-motorized Transportation
Adopting non-motorized forms of transportation provides another approach to reducing the oil consumed by motorized transportation. In practical terms this means bicycles and walking. Both modes tend to be more time consuming and limited in flexibility compared to automobiles. However, with more jobs being located in suburban campuses near workers' homes, nonmotorized transportation has become more practical for more people. Using bicycles and walking have only the most minimal negative environmental consequences.

6.2. Industrial Sector Uses
Natural gas constitutes the primary alternative to oil in the industrial sector. Environmental consequences of expanded natural gas production are covered in section 4.3. and the 5-Year Program EIS. The other alternatives to oil in the industrial sector tend to be identical to those for natural gas. These other alternatives are discussed in section 7.2. because natural gas is a more important fuel in the industrial sector than oil.

6.3. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
As is true in the industrial sector, natural gas constitutes the primary alternative to oil in the residential and commercial sectors. Similarly, environmental consequences of expanded natural gas production are covered in section 4.3. and the 5-Year Program EIS. The other alternatives to oil for the residential and commercial sectors tend to be identical to those for natural gas. These other alternatives are discussed in section 7.2. because natural gas is a more important fuel in the residential and commercial sectors than oil.

6.4. Electricity Generation
Natural gas is also one of the major alternatives to oil for electricity generation. Environmental consequences of expanded natural gas production are covered in section 4.3. and the 5-Year Program EIS. The other alternatives to oil for electricity generation tend to be identical to the alternatives to natural gas. These other alternatives are discussed in section 7.1. because natural gas is a more important fuel for electricity generation than oil.

6.S. Non-Energy Uses
The major non-energy uses of oil and NGL's are as a feedstock for chemicals and as a raw material for solvents, lubricants, asphalts, and waxes. The alternatives for both types of nonenergy use tend to be identical so they are discussed together.

25

6.5.1. Alternative Raw Materials
Oil and NGL's consist of hydrocarbons of varying complexity. Substitutes must be hydrocarbons with roughly similar chemical compositions. Thus, the list of substitute raw materials is limited to coal and biological sources.

6.5.1.1. Coal
For the most part, coal is suitable only for the chemical feedstock uses of oil. Although coal is a cheap and abundant raw material, it tends to require more (and more expensive) conversion before it is suitable as a substitute for oil and NGL's. In a nutshell, coal can be converted into most chemicals presently processed from oil and NGL's; however, it is usually much more expensive to do so. The environmental consequences of increased coal extraction are discussed in section 7.1.1.1., where coal is considered as an alternative fuel for generating electricity.

6.5.1.2. Biological Products
Products from living biological entities can be used for most non-energy uses of oil and NGL's. The important thing to understand is that very large quantities of oil and NGL's are used to produce non-energy products. To harvest enough of a biological product to make an important contribution to this industry would require a large-scale production system. Presently, some biological products do compete as feedstocks and for such products as waxes. Soybeans are the most obvious domestic example. The vast acreage committed to soybean production is an example of the kind of commitment that would have to be mounted to substitute for a meaningful percentage of oil and NGL's. The major impediment to such conversion is its cost. Greatly increasing the harvest of biological resources would mean conversion of significant land area to this new use. The result would depend on the biological source and the region chosen to provide that source. Regardless of the option chosen, consequences would almost undoubtedly include: o loss of habitat for many species of wildlife, including those that are threatened and endangered o increased soil erosion o water quality degradation o added dust and related forms of air pollution o increased use of insecticides, herbicides, and other potentially harmful agricultural chemicals

6.5.2. Using Less of the Products
Among the major forms of conservation is using less of the oil-based products. In the case of chemicals, lubricants, etc., this would entail lowering our standard ofliving. It would mean things like painting our houses less frequently, cutting back on consumption of pharmaceuticals, and not cleaning clothes and houses so often. A major future use of plastics made from oil and NGL's is as lighter-weight major parts for automobiles. Cutting back on plastic parts for automobiles would make the autos heavier, which would expand their need for oil products as fuel. Meaningful reduction of these non-fuel uses would lead to a lower standard of living with

26

questionable positive impacts on the natural and human environments.

6.5.3. Recycling
Plastics are easily recycled although only a small percentage of plastics are recycled in the U.S. Recycling solvents, lubricants, and other oil-based chemicals would also seem to be an ideal way to save some of the raw material input. Unfortunately, used chemicals of these types are often contaminated with dangerous and environmentally damaging materials. Removing these contaminants is often more expensive than the cost of virgin raw materials. For example, recycled motor oil from automobiles has mostly been mixed in' with residual oil and burned in boilers. Disposing of the contaminants can lead to processes that add to air and water pollution. Where processes can be developed to reprocess these types of chemicals in an environmentally acceptable manner, the result could be a saving of oil and NGL's with relatively benign environmental consequences.

7. Alternatives to Natural Gas and Their Environmental Impacts
The same five basic ways exist to replace either OCS gas or oil: import, produce onshore, switch fuel, substitute fuel-saving technology, or accept less service. The principal alternatives to OCS natural gas are oil and gas from onshore production. Oil importation and onshore gas production are covered in section 4.3. This section will review the other potential substitutes for OCS gas.

7. 1. Electricity Generation
Electricity generation is the fastest growing use of natural gas. As discussed in section 3.3., natural gas is especially well suited to producing ramping power to meet peak loads. This is the most expensive and valuable type of power production. However, combined-cycle gas plants are finding more frequent application to base-load and intermediate power supply.

7. 1. 1. Alternative Sources of Electricity
Table 7 provides statistics on utilities' capability to generate electricity using different fuels and the amount of electricity generated using the various fuels in 2004.

7.1.1.1. Coal
As table 7 makes clear, the United States generates more electricity using coal than any other fuel. Coal is best suited to base-load and slowly ramping power production because coal-fired power plants are relatively slow to bring on and off line. For the proper application, coal-fired power plants compete reasonably well with other generators. However, in order to be efficient, coal plants must be large. In addition, air pollution control regulations require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment. As a result, building a new coal plant entails a very significant capital investment with interest costs that can become prohibitive if the cost of money rises. Thus, utilities have completed few coal-fired electric generating plants in recent years. Nevertheless, in the face of rising gas prices, utilities are planning the construction of many new 27

coal plants. It remains to be seen whether the plants will be built. Coal extraction may cause especially severe impacts on water resources that are degraded by acidic drainage from active and abandoned mines and by silt from earth movement, which is especially serious in strip and auger mining. Ground water is often polluted or disrupted by coal extraction because coal seams serve as the aquifer in many locations. Coal mining also is associated with air pollution from dust and machinery exhaust. The machinery also produces noise pollution. Coal's impact on visual aesthetics is especially severe because the surface scars from strip mining and the mountainside cuts from auger mining have an especially significant effect on scenic mountain areas.

7.1.1.2. Nuclear
Nuclear power plants are almost exclusively used for base-load power production. Although nuclear power was originally promoted as a very cheap form of electricity generation, it has proven to be quite expensive. Providing the margin of safety society expects from a nuclear plant requires safety systems that multiply by several times the cost of building a nuclear plant. Similarly, safe operations cost many times the operating costs originally envisioned. Finally, finding a socially acceptable location for disposing of the spent nuclear fuel cells is much more difficult and expensive than originally expected. In table 7 one can see that nuclear plants have the highest ratio of generation to capacity of any major category of electric generation. Where they are installed, they are usually the base-load workhorses of the utilities' generation systems. Nonetheless, the lack of any planned nuclear capacity addition demonstrates their prohibitively high costs (EIA 2005). In the next 15 or 20 years many presently operating nuclear units are scheduled for decommissioning. If this occurs on schedule, it will lead to a significant increase in the demand for other forms of electricity 28

generating capacity. Development of ultra-safe standardized units and greater creativity in siting are the keys to an expanded future role for nuclear power plants. Compared with other forms of large-scale electricity generation, nuclear power has relatively minor environmental impacts. Mine tailings from uranium mining have caused radioactive water pollution in the West, but this is more a result of formerly inadequate regulation or lax enforcement than it is a problem with present production. The tremendous cooling needs of nuclear reactors can lead to abnormal temperature increases in bodies of water used for plant cooling. The size of the containment vessels can also cause visual aesthetic degradation. Recent events have dramatized the vulnerability of nuclear plants to acts of terrorism that could lead to the release of radioactive material.

7.1.1.3. Hydroelectric
Many of the best hydroelectric sites in the U.S. have already been utilized or set aside for aesthetic reasons. In addition hydroelectric dams in several parts of the country have been breached to provide pathways for anadromous fish and for other environmental purposes. As a result, hydroelectric power won't make a significant contribution to additional domestic electricity generation. Pump storage, which is a method for storing less expensive base-load power from off-peak hours for meeting peak demand, could substitute for some natural gas-fired turbines used for peaking power. Environmental impacts from pump storage facilities tend to be localized and to consist of destruction of wildlife habitat and, in open systems, disruption of stream flows. At this time no pump storage projects are being planned for the United States (EIA 2005).

7.1 .1.4. Geothermal
Geothermal electricity generation is limited by the availability of geothermal resources and the inadequate technology to take advantage of many forms of geothermal energy. Geothermal generating stations may create air pollution, water pollution, and land disturbance. Water discharged by geothermal developments is often highly corrosive and full of rocks (Hazen 1996).

7. 1. 1.5. Biomass
Next to wind and geothermal, biomass makes a larger contribution to U.S. electricity generation than any other non-conventional power source. Most of the biomass burned for power is wood or specific types of waste wood products. Obviously, this power source is dependent on a large supply of low-cost wood. At some point trees must be cut to obtain the wood for generating power with this form of biomass. Cutting trees can lead to additional water pollution from soil erosion caused by timber road construction and skidding the fallen trees. Ground without the protection of trees, especially if it is burned, may also be subject to increased erosion. The logging also creates a location unsuitable for wildlife requiring trees for food, cover, and protection. Some of the displaced wildlife could be endangered species. Another source of biomass for power is municipal solid waste. Burning solid waste without 29

creating air and water pollution problems is costly. This means such systems usually cannot compete with other sources of power without sizable subsidies. However, in locations where suitable sites for landfills are becoming inaccessible, subsidies may be appropriate. Some individual solid waste incinerators, for example the Lancaster County (Pennsylvania) Resource Recovery System, can solve the solid waste disposal problem; generate electricity; and produce negligible air, water, and land pollution. Unfortunately, the combination of cost and technical sophistication makes waste to power systems unlikely sources of significant electricity generation in the near future.

7.1.1.6. Wind
The amount of electricity generated by wind power has expanded greatly over the last decade driven in part by significant technological improvements. During 1998 and 1999, 925 megawatts of wind-powered generating capacity were added in the U.S., mostly on Iowa and Minnesota farmland (AWEA 2006). Much of the expansion in wind generating facilities has been fueled by generous subsidies for building and operating these generators. Nevertheless, wind power contributes less than one percent of present-day U.S. electricity generation. The wind power industry projects that wind could provide six percent of U.S. power production, about 24.8 billion kWh, by 2020. A major source of this optimism is the 90 percent drop in wind energy costs over the last 20 years (A WEA 2006). The main problem with wind powered electricity generation is wind availability. Most wind systems only operate 25 percent of the time at 50 percent or less of capacity. The lack of wind constancy causes system stress and difficult voltage regulation. Early problems with noise and interference with television, radio, and other media transmissions have largely been solved through better designs and non-metallic wind vanes (Hazen 1996). Recently, planning has begun on two projects offshore the U.S. coast. One is off Nantucket and the other off Long Island. The relative constancy of winds in these areas and their proximity to areas of high demand were important attractions to the developers. Although some European studies have shown the structures to lead to relatively large areas avoided by sea birds, the environmental impacts have not yet been shown to be significantly negative. However, wind-powered generating equipment must be carefully sited. Construction of the pads and access roads for wind farms located in arid, mountainous country can disturb large areas of sensitive land. The result is greatly increased soil erosion compared with what it would be from more traditional land uses leading to siltation in nearby streams. The Altamont Pass wind resource area in California has been associated with high levels of raptor mortality (Audubon 1991). Thus, wind energy development sites must consider the locations of major migration routes and areas that might funnel birds into the machines. Appalachian wind farms have experienced relatively high numbers of bat deaths. The industry is studying this problem with the hope of remedying the situation in the future. The most modem wind generators are very large and revolve relatively slowly. These slower generators may partially alleviate the impacts to birds that have been noted with older models. Visual aesthetics must also be considered in wind energy siting decision. The crests of ridges and the sides of canyons are often the highlights of scenic areas. Generators in stark relief against the 30

sky could create a devastating loss of aesthetic value to some observers. On the other hand, wind generation equipment may be aesthetically compatible with farmland in the Phlin States that have some of the most reliable wind resources in the U.S. Wind generation in shallow waters offshore entails similar technology to that used onshore except that a structure must be built to raise the generating equipment above the level of the water. However, unlike parts of Western Europe, 90 percent of U.S. offshore wind resources lie in deep water. Deep water entails much more elaborate and expensive structures to protect the generators. Estimates of shallow water cost lie in the range of $.08 to $.15 per kwh. Deep-water costs are expected to be double those figures although technological improvements and economies of scale could lower that number significantly. Offshore environmental impacts include visual impacts; noise and vibrations; collisions, habitat dislocation, and navigational disorientation for birds; alterations of natural underwater environments; and impacts on fisheries and marine traffic. Potential siting constraints include water depth, migration routes, shipping lanes, pipelines, and military operations.

7. 1. 1.7. Solar
Solar energy is converted to electricity primarily through solar thermal or photovoltaic technology. Solar thermal conversion uses three types of conversion technology: parabolic troughs, parabolic dishes, and heliostat/central receiver systems. The parabolic troughs and dishes collect solar energy as part of distributed collection systems that transmit solar heat via a fluid system to a point where the heat creates steam to power a turbine. Heliostats are mirrors mounted on an axis maneuvered by a mechanism that focuses the reflected solar energy on a single receiving point. The energy from many heliostats at the central receiver heats water there to drive a turbine. Although research continues, major breakthroughs in solar thermal conversion have been limited of late (Hazen 1996). Photovoltaic technology on the other hand has been a hotbed of recent technological improvement. Photovoltaics create electricity directly through the activity of solar energy on semiconductors. Cells of the semiconducting material are arrayed on trays that may be stacked to maximize solar capture. Alternatively, the material may be laid out in a thin film that should be relatively inexpensive to manufacture and deploy. Photovoltaic systems are finding increased use as power facilities far from existing power lines. As the cost of photovoltaic cells has declined and their reliability improved, in many cases it has become cheaper to install photovoltaic cells than run a long-distance power line (EREN 2001). For instance, a program has been initiated on the Navajo Indian Reservation to install photovoltaic solar electric generating systems on scattered homesites throughout the reservation (Rushlo 2000). Nevertheless, solar powered electricity remains a high cost alternative. Indeed, the cost for thin film technology for large-scale power production is still based on estimates and models. A relatively reliable study suggested that solar energy costs would have to decline tenfold in order to compete with present commodity electricity costs (Zweibel 1999). It is fair to say that for the foreseeable future solar energy will not make a major contribution to electricity generation because of its cost. MMS is investigating the use of solar energy to produce electricity on the OCS.

31

Photovoltaic electricity generation has virtually no negative environmental impacts in the power production process itself. Production of the equipment may entail environmental degradation associated with the manufacturing process, although this should be localized and controllable. However, if solar thermal power were ever to make a measurable contribution to national electricity generation, vast areas of land would have to be given over to this technology. Although the areas best suited to solar energy tend to be arid and thus fragile, many areas might be flat or on gentle slopes and not especially susceptible to wholesale erosion. Nevertheless, large-scale loss of vegetation and wildlife habitat, soil erosion, and resulting water pollution can be expected from large-scale solar thermal generating facilities. Such facilities could also be aesthetically displeasing.

7.1.1.8. Advanced Technologies
Ocean currents. Submerged turbines similar to wind turbines can extract energy from ocean currents. The system for producing energy from ocean currents would consist of the rotor blade turbine, a generator for converting the rotational energy into electricity, and a means of transporting the electrical current to shore for incorporation into the electrical grid. Problems attendant on this technology include the necessity of maintaining corrosion resistance and prevention of marine growth buildup. Marine current energy is likely to have minimal negative environmental impacts; however, fish, marine mammals, shipping routes, and recreational fishing and diving will need protection. Risks may also be encountered from slowing the current flow by extracting energy. One study suggested that if 10% ofthe Gulf Stream's energy were extracted near Florida, there could be significant climate changes in northwestern Europe. Wave action. The energy from waves can be captured using a variety of technologies. The cost of energy produced by wave action depends on technological, physical, and economic factors. One study found the cost in areas with relatively high wave energy was in the range of$0.09 to $O.ll1kWh after tax !'hcentives. However, expanded production volume can significantly reduce equipment costs. The eventual cost of wave-generated electricity with mature technologies has been estimated to be competitive with wind-generated electricity. Wave energy may have environmental impacts on marine habitat, lead to releases oftoxic hydraulic fluids, cause visual disturbances and noise pollution, and conflict with commercial shipping and recreational boating. Other. Tidal energy and ocean thermal gradients are other potential sources of generating capacity. These sources often rely on relatively unique circumstances to justify their construction. For the most part, these exotic sources lack the potential to make a serious contribution to U.S. electricity supply. In most situations these alternatives are too expensive, lack feasible technology, or both. It is extremely unlikely that any exotic form of electricity generation will make even a one percent contribution to the U.S. electricity supply during the planning period for this program MMS is preparing a separate Programmatic EIS for oes renewable energy. This document will include an assessment of hydrogen production, solar, wind, current, and wave energy sources. It will assess the technical status, economic viability, and potential environmental impacts of each of these sources on the oes.

7.1.2. More Efficient Electricity Generation
Using more efficient generating equipment to produce the same amount of electricity as now could save a meaningful amount of natural gas and oil. Examples of how this could be done include: o replacing aged equipment with modem conventional equipment o replacing straight turbines with much more fuel efficient combined cycle systems o adopting the next generation of nuclear reactor should they become available o building one of the new generation of coal-fired generating plants such as atmospheric fluidized bed, pressurized fluidized bed, or limestone injection The problem is that modem, efficient generating plants are very expensive. Power companies may have trouble justifying the expenditures to their stockholders on a financial basis. Furthermore, state regulatory agencies may be unwilling to allow additions to rates for plant construction while they allow standard rate adjustments for fuel costs. Saving natural gas and oil through more efficient generation would reduce the incidence and risk of all the environmental impacts associated with the natural gas and oil production saved. Some of the conserved resources would have come from the OCS.

7.1.3. More Efficient and Less Electricity Consumption
By using less electricity and by using it more efficiently, the industrial, commercial, and residential sectors could save the fuels used to generate that electricity. These types of savings will be discussed in sections 7.2 and 7.3.

7.2. Industrial Sector Uses
7.2. 1. Alternative Fuels
The trend in the industrial sector is to switch to natural gas or electricity. This means that other fuels are less suitable for industrial applications, more expensive, or both. Oil is the most likely alternative fuel that most industries would choose as a substitute for natural gas. Impacts from oil production are covered in section 4.3 . and the 5-Year Program EIS.

7.2.1.1. Coal
Coal can be an effective alternative to natural gas in industrial applications where rapid peaking is not a requirement. However, it is an expensive alternative in all but the largest new applications. Among the characteristics that add to the cost of new coal plants are: o the expense of efficient-sized coal-burning facilities o the need for expensive air pollution control equipment o the expense of transporting and handling coal The environmental impacts associated with coal are covered in section 7.1.1.1.

7.2. 1.2. Electricity

33

Electricity can be substituted for natural gas (and oil) in many industrial applications. Although electricity tends to be more expensive than the use of a raw fuel, it moves the source of air pollution to another location that may have less stringent pollution control regulations than the industrial site. Furthermore, an electric utility can achieve economies of scale in pollution control that might not be available to the individual firm. The environmental impacts attributable to the generation of electricity are dependent on the fuel used and these are covered in section 7.1.1.

7.2.2. More Efficient Energy Usage
Although the industrial sector as a whole spends a considerable amount of time and money developing methods for using energy more efficiently, opportunities remain for saving vast quantities of energy in the industrial sector. Many consulting firms make it their business to help firms use energy more efficiently, but they tend to help only those firms with high enough levels of inefficiency to pay a portion of efficiency savings to a consultant. Many smaller opportunities for improvements go unaddressed. This is true for the use of natural gas, oil, electricity, and even other energy inputs such as coal. One way firms in the industrial sector can improve their energy efficiency is by adopting stateof-the-art equipment. In many cases, a new process or new space heating and cooling equipment can save enough in energy costs to pay for itself in a reasonably short payback period. Choosing equipment that is the right size in terms of energy efficiency for the task at hand can reap related savmgs. Another way firms can save energy is through improving the energy efficiency of their industrial processes. Although most ""reengineering"" activities in industry are aimed at using labor more efficiently, the same approach can be used to save on the use of energy. Combinations of new processes with new, properly sized equipment can lead to especially significant energy savings. Although some negative environmental impacts may be associated with the production of materials or equipment installed in the process of achieving greater energy efficiency, these impacts tend to be negligible. Thus, improvements in the efficiency with which the industrial sector uses energy are almost entirely beneficial to the environment.

7.3. Residential and Commercial Sector Uses
7.3. 1. Alternative Fuels
Just as in the industrial sector, the trend in the residential and commercial sectors is to switch to natural gas, when it is available, or electricity. Residential and commercial facilities have relatively many alternative fuel options.

7.3.1.1 Electricity
When gas is unavailable, electricity is the fuel of choice for new residential and commercial facilities in all but the coldest parts of the country. Heat pumps are the technological breakthrough that has allowed electricity to compete with products made from oil. Environmental impacts from the production of electricity are covered in section 7.1 .
34

7.3.1.2. Oil
Among the products made from oil and available to the residential and commercial sectors are fuel oil, kerosene, and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Each of these products can be competitive with natural gas under certain circumstances, the most common of which is expensive access to a natural gas pipeline. Oil-based products are also well suited to areas where it is too cold for electric heat pumps to operate effectively. Impacts from oil production are covered in section 4.3. of this paper and in the 5-Year Program EIS.

7.3.1.3. Coal
Coal is still burned in many older houses. Even in modem houses, coal is still used as an auxiliary source of heat, sometimes switching off with wood depending on relative costs or availability. The environmental impacts associated with coal mining are enumerated in section 7.1.1.1.

7.3.1.4. Biomass (Wood)
Wood is burned for heat in many houses. Cutting firewood in moderation may cause little negative environmental impact and may even serve to open up forests to let the remaining trees develop and to provide some ecological diversity. Where such cutting is carried to an extreme it may destroy forest habitat and lead to soil erosion resulting in long-term damage to the land and waters . In addition, habitat for tree-dependent wildlife may be lost with resultant loss ofthe wildlife popUlation, which may include endangered species. Other forms of biomass can be burned or they can be processed into methane gas for use in a similar manner to natural gas although these alternatives see little application in the residential and commercial sectors.

7.3.1.5. Solar
Solar energy is almost exclusively an auxiliary source of heat to the residential and commercial sectors. However, especially in sunny areas, the contribution of solar energy can be significant. Simple approaches to letting the sun warm parts of a dwelling, especially those made of heat retaining materials, work especially well. Such passive solar systems can reduce heating bills as much as 50 percent (EREN 2001). Solar energy also works effectively as an auxiliary water heating system. A typical solar water heating system will reduce the need for conventional water heating by two-thirds (EREN 2001). The problem is that these auxiliary systems need a main or a backup system including an alternative source of energy. Where the alternative source is electricity, the demand during times oflow solar radiation could force electric utilities to provide relatively expensive peak demand at a cost to all customers whether or not they used solar heat. Recently, photovoltaics for residential and commercial applications have come on the market that can compete with other sources of energy in certain situations. The use of photovoltaic films has been a major breakthrough in helping to make these systems more economical. The solar powered systems still need expensive and complex storage systems or connections to the electric power grid.

35

Manufacturing solar energy capturing material could lead to environmental deterioration; however, that environmental cost is likely to be minor. Environmental impacts of residential and commercial solar energy use at the point of capture are likely to be negligible.

7.3.2. More Efficient Energy Usage
As is true of the industrial sector, the residential and commercial sectors can use correctly sized state-of-the-art equipment to increase the efficiency of their energy usage. However, in terms of more efficient use, these sectors have some specific steps open to them that have broad application across the sectors. Most important is the use of better designs and materials. Better designs can take advantage of passive solar energy, minimize openings to the outside, and take into account airflow as well as temperature to maximize comfort. Better materials include muItipaned glass, insulated sheathing, and more effective insulation materials. Insulation and weatherization can be especially effective in the residential sector. Programs to subsidize insulation and weatherization sponsored by electric utilities have cost-effectively spared the utilities from having to install expensive new generating plants. In more sophisticated applications, zoning and time-of-day controls can be used to hold down unnecessary energy usage in large residences and commercial establishments. More efficient appliances and applianceusage can also add to the efficiency of the residential sector. Any negative environmental impacts from increased production of more energy efficient heating and cooling equipment and appliances would be only marginal. Therefore, almost all the improvements in energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors would have positive impacts on the natural environment.

7.3.3. Less Energy Usage
In the industrial sector, any decrease in energy usage not associated with increased energy efficiency would lead directly to a decrease in production. In the residential sector, less energy usage might lead to lower utility; however, the tradeoff might be a reasonable one. For instance, less heating and cooling might lead people to change their dress habits without causing much

inconvenience. Everyday decisions like this could lead to positive impacts on the natural
environment.

8. A Note on ""Conservation""
The two types of energy conservation, substituting energy-saving technology and using less of the energy service, share two important characteristics: 1. There may be some negative environmental impacts associated with any new equipment required to achieve the efficiency, but these impacts will tend to be marginal. 2. The net effect of these measures will generally be positive from an environmental point of view, even though they could lead to unintended consequences. Furthermore, there is ample opportunity in our society to provide cost-effective subsidies to 36

entice people to implement various conservation measures. However, for any given level of teclmology the opportunities are not unlimited. Enticement to conserve will have to be constant. After an initial period of success, each additional unit of conservation at a given teclmological level will become incrementally more expensive. In other words, absent teclmological change, conservation has an upward sloping supply curve just as most other goods and services do. Thus, our society could decide to save energy and save money in the process, but only for a while. Eventually, saving more energy would become too expensive to continue, unless breakthrough technology can come to the rescue. Some energy analysts believe that society has within its power the ability to implement technological improvements that could change the nature of our energy system. The Rocky Mountain Institute has published a volume titled, Winning the Oil Endgame, in which the authors detail just such a system of change based partially on already available technology and partially on technological improvements that they believe are well within the capabilities of modern science and engineering. Their focus is on substituting conservation and other fuel sources for the vast quantity of oil imported by the US. from unstable foreign sources. They offer the possibility of achieving these goals in the not too distant future (Lovins 2006).

9. Conclusion
In the short run, oil and natural gas are essential elements in the U.S. energy equation. Within the next few years, even vigorous government action can only shift the mix of energy alternatives to a minor degree. Any major change in the energy mix will also require changes in behavior by individuals and institutions not under direct control of the government in the US. system. In an intermediate time period, other energy options like wind powered electricity generation and hybrid-electric cars can begin to make inroads on hydrocarbon use if government gives these alternatives a sufficient boost. In the longer run, new generation nuclear electricity generation and fuel cell powered transportation could revolutionize the energy picture. These long run possibilities won't come to pass until most of the development associated with the present 5-Year Program has peaked out and been decommissioned. Until such a time as the US . economy can rely on alternatives with less serious environmental impacts, especially in the area of greenhouse gases, oil and natural gas will remain key interim fuels. Even in the foreseeable future, oil will be needed to power airplanes, to provide heat in cold rural locations, and for non-energy uses. Natural gas will likely still be the fuel of choice for peaking electric power. Alternatives likely to help minimize environmental impacts in the long run are topped by conservation, the least polluting, most cost-effective option up to a point. However, without revolutionary teclmological changes, conservation benefits are limited, as noted in section 8 of this paper. Other comers include hybrid cars and fuel cells in the ground transportation sector. New generation nuclear backed up with wind may power baseload electricity. Finally, hydrogen for urban industrial, commercial, and residential heating and related uses rounds out the list of potential minimum polluters likely to populate the energy economy. Oil and natural gas will be needed in the interim to power an economy that can generate the capital needed to implement these less polluting alternatives. The most likely and largest available alternatives to OCS production are imported oil and LNG. The environmental impacts associated with these 37

alternatives represent important considerations when Weighing the no action alternative

MMS Response to DPP Questions:

o

On page 7, it says that ""the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars."" Steve didn't see that number split out anywhere in the report (after flipping through to the end), so could MMS break that down ... how much of that is taxes, and how much is profits?

Answer: The sum of Federal corporate taxes and corporate net income generated by the new program is forecasted to be $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 million in present value dollars. The break-down of these measures is, for the nominal dollar case, approximately $400 billion in taxes and $700 billion in net profits. In the present value dollar case, MMS estimates about $50 billion is in taxes and $80 billion in corporate profits.

o

On page 23, there's a reference to the 1997 MMS cumulative effects report, which is a fulfillment of the OCSLA Section 20(e) requirement that MMS report to Congress on
2

cumulative effects every three years. Have there been more recent cumulative effects reports, and if not, why not?
Answer: The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66), Section 3003 terminated the requirement of submittal of the Report on Effects of Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Activities on Human, Marine, and Coastal Environments under section 20(e) of the oes Lands Act (see http://frwebgate .access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1 04 cong public laws&docid=f:pubI66.104.pdf). The last report required by OCSLA Section 20(e) was published in 1997 and was entitled Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Natural Gas Resource Management Program: Cumulative Effects 1992-1994, OCS Report MMS 97-0027. You may download a copy of the report at http://www.mms.gov/itd/hdqrspubs.htm.

o

On page 25, it mentions a lawsuit against the 2007 5-year plan. Could we get copies of the filings to date and information on status of that lawsuit?

Answer: Solicitor's Office is providing copies and the documents will be delivered to you by February 20.

o

On page 78, there's a reference to the report, ""Energy Alternatives and the Environment"". The link to this report on the 2007-2012 5-yr program page apparently is broken. Can we get him an electronic copy of that report?
Answer: The link has been fixed on mms.gov. Electronic file attached.

o

Can we get a map with indications of the distance from the FL coast of the various parts of that DPP area (both the area with proposed full leasing and the area that has the no permanent structure buffer)?
Answer: See attached maps in two formats with contour lines at 25-mile intervals.

o

On page 90; Table 5 - presents resource estimates by PA for all ""unleased, undiscovered, economically recoverable resources."" Can we provide the UERR for the ""leased"" resources?
Answer: Excel spreadsheet attached.

o

On page 93/94; the DPP talks about the OECM model for estimating environmental and social costs associated with OCS activities. Can we provide the data ""inputs""?
Answer: The inputs to the model are Exploration and Development (E&D) scenarios and Production Profiles prepared inhouse. MMS considers this information as privileged.

o

Can we provide information on the recent contract for the Mid-Atlantic study?

Answer: This study consists of a data search and synthesis of existing environmental and socioeconomic information for the northern and central Atlantic area. An evaluation will be made of the relative contributions of physical oceanographic processes to cross-shelf transport, as well as the contributions of buoyancy and meteorological forcing to seawater transport.

Interior's Minerals Management Service Disburses Record $23.4 Billion in FY 2008
State share from energy production hits new high of $2.59 billion
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthome today announced that Interior's Minerals Management Service had distributed a record $23.4 billion to state, American Indian and federal accounts from onshore and offshore energy production during Fiscal Year 2008.
Kempthorne said the record disbursements from royalties, rents, and bonuses shattered the 2007 total of $11 ,6 billion, far surpassing the previous record of $12,8 billion disbursed in FY 2006. ""These funds provide a critical source of revenues that are so important to today's federal and state budgets as well as to American Indian communities across the country,"" Kempthome said. ""Particularly in today's economic environment, these revenues represent an increasingly important source of funding for many federal, state and tribal budgets,"" Kempthome noted, adding that funds disbursed to individual states and tribes support a range of projects from infrastructure improvements and capital works to funding for education. Kempthorne attributed the record disbursements to higher energy prices during FY 2008 and the more than $10 billion in bonus bids paid by companies to lease tracts for offshore energy exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, as well as from onshore lease sales. As part of the total, a record $2,59 billion was disbursed to 35 states as their share of federal revenues collected from energy production within their borders; $17.3 billion was disbursed to the U .S. Treasury; and $534 million was disbursed to 34 American Indian Tribes and 30,000 individual American Indian mineral owners. Since it was established in 1982, MMS has disbursed more than $200 billion to federal, state, and American Indian accounts. Since 2001 , a total of$89.2 billion has been dispersed, and $12.6 billion of that went to the states.

The disbursements to the states represent their cumulative share of revenues collected from energy production on federal lands within their borders, and from federal offshore oil and gas tracts adjacent to their shores. In addition, MMS funds various special use accounts, including $2 billion contributed to the Reclamation Fund for water projects; $897 million to the Land & Water Conservation Fund; and $150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund. The $2.6 billion disbursed to 35 states in FY 2008 compares to the $1.97 billion disbursed in FY 2007, and the previous high of $2.2 billion disbursed in FY 2006. The state of Wyoming again led all states in FY 2008 by receiving more than $1.2 billion as its share of revenues collected from energy production on federal lands within its borders, including oil, gas and coal production. New Mexico followed with more than $614 million in receipts. Coastal states with producing federal offshore tracts within three miles of their state waters also receive 27 percent of royalties generated in those areas. Remaining offshore revenues collected by the Minerals Management Service are deposited in various accounts of the U.S. Treasury, including the General Fund, and to the Coastal Impact Assistant Program for states. States receiving revenues through Fiscal Year 2008 include: Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Florida Idaho Illinois Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Mexico North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania $15,836,221.38 $38,556,903.53 $266,834.26 $13,189,227.20 $103,445,963.15 $178,377,966.07 $6,298.00 $1,978,855.53 $286,561.67 $191.50 $2,605,367.43 $508,473.37 $49,466,635.80 $1,171,444.97 $13,030.27 $1,572,333.15 $4,561,311.95 $48,943,889.42 $40,800.27 $17,622,148.72 $614,829,204.51 $23,392,224.43 $574,971.75 $7,240,652.39 $294,100.53 $69,368.41

In addition to state disbursements, MMS disburses revenues to the county level in support of geothermal energy production. Under the Energy Policy Act of2005, the federal government disburses 25 percent of receipts from geothermal energy production directly to counties where that production occurs. About $9.1 million was disbursed to counties in six states for the alternative energy resource in FY 2008, more than doubling the $4.3 million that was disbursed to counties the previous fiscal year. Counties receiving geothermal receipts are located in California, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. Interior's Minerals Management Service is the federal agency responsible for collecting, auditing and disbursing revenues associated with mineral leases on federal and American Indian lands, and on the Outer Continental Shelf. Disbursements are made on a monthly basis from royalties, rents and bonuses collected by the MMS. ###

Steve - In response to your January 21 email inquiries regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report: 1. The report mentioned that it was an every-other-year thing, but Steve believes he has seen interim reports in the other years. (Have there been interim reports?) Will there be an update to the data in this report coming out this year? The deepwater report is published every-other year (see following). While we are not aware of any interim reports, there is deepwater information that is generated as needed. This is reflected on MMS's Deepwater webpage: http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/offshore/deepwtr.html.

2. What is the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? . No. Drillship availability was being pushed into hurricane season so the cruise was delayed until spring 2009 to maximize the chance for a successful endeavor.
3. Was there any criteria used to define BP, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? This is described on page 14 as ""In this report, we define major companies to include BP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and Shell. The grouping of these four entities does not indicate a regulatory conclusion or an analysis of production size. It is merely a convenient category for the purpose of comparison."" These larger companies, with greater resources to draw on, tend to focus on larger resources that may take greater capital to develop than smaller independents can consider. This distinction simply makes a convenient way to capture the differences in company philosophy that tends to be seen in bidding patterns.

4. On page 20, there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250. Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? Companies do not have to give a reason for forfeiting the 1/5th payment on their bonus bid. Typically, a forfeiture is based on a company acquiring new information after they have placed their bid. If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally

9/2112010

Page 3 of3

determined, the company can choose to limit their loss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale. 5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so . We will get back to you as soon as possible. 6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement document found at http://www.mms.gov/revaldiv/PDFs/FinallnvRptToCongress050 106. pdf. 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GaM? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible .

5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories . On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)?
(See attached file ""1996-2007LeasingHistory.pdf""). This contains tables showing leases by year leased , year released , and water depth as well as graphs depicting the lease history. The focus is on leases that were leased a second time however, there were a few leases that were re-Ieased for a third time. Since these were fairly small numbers, these were not shown by water depth. It would be a fair assumption that most of these re-Ieased for a third time tended to be shallow water. In more recent years , the blocks that have been re-Ieased tend to be the shallow-water blocks. This is related to the primary terms for shallow-water blocks being 5 years and for . deepwater blocks being 10 years.

7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM?
(See attached file ""Fig56-DeepWaterReport-SupportingData .xls""). This file contains the data that were used to generate Figure 56 in the Deepwater Report.

Hi Steve, See answers to your questions regarding the attached spreadsheet in green font below. Our analyst in the Gulf who had been assigned the two remaining questions you had regarding the 2008 Deepwater GOM report has been occupied with the Secretary's 45-day report . I will check on the status . Thanks, Cheri

From: Feldgus, Steve [mailto:Steve.Feldgus@mail,house.gov] Sent: Tuesday, March 10, 2009 5:53 PM To: Herdt, Lyn Subject: Question about attached sheet
Hi Lyn ,

2

You sent us the attached spreadsheet a few weeks ago, and I just wanted to check on a few things. The UTRR numbers are a bit different than the 2006 Assessment - the spreadsheet shows a total of 85.26 billion barrels of UTRR, while the 2006assessment shows 85.88 billion barrels, which is a minor difference I'm not too concerned about (although I am interested in knowing if these numbers are updated UTRR numbers that supersede what's in the 2006 Assessment).

MMS Response: These numbers are not updated (or superseded) UTRR numbers from the 2006 Assessment. The difference between the Total of 85.26 Billion Mis oil UTRR on the attached spreadsheet and tile 85.88 Bil/ion bbls oil from the assessment lies in the Alaska oes areas of negligible potential that were not reported in the OPP (or on the attached spreadsheet). The areas that make up the difference are: Hope (.15Bbbls oil), Norton (.06 Bbbls oil), Navarin (.13 BM/s oil), St. George Basin (.21 Bbbls oil), Shumagin (.01 Bbbls oil), and Kodiak (.05 Bbbls oil).
But the big difference is in the UERR, which was 65.61 billion barrels at $60/bbl in the 2006 Assessment, but in the spreadsheets is 52.1 billion barrels at the same price. Is that a reflection of increased commodity costs (steel, etc.), or is there something else behind it?

MMS Response: Yes, as you mention cost increases have had a significant impact on UERR's especially in Alaska. Several significant updates to the economic assumptions were made for the 2008 economic assessment. The most influential change involved the adjustment of costs according to oil prices, where costs follow price trends. This fundamental relationship was not modeled in previous MMS assessments, so economic resource potential was generally over-estimated at high prices and under-estimated at low prices. For the 2008 economic assessment, costs were updated to a higher base price and then adjustments to costs with increasing oil prices were made automatically in a recentfy improved version of our assessment model (GRASP). In addition to development and drilling cost increases, gas processing and transportation costs were other important cost updates. These costs are typically input as gas tariffs (Mcf) and do not have an automatic cost-price adjustment in the GRASP model. For Arctic provinces, the gas transportation tariff was increased (+$1.601 Met) to reflect the increase in costs for a future gas pipeline. LNG facilities for gas exports were increased by $1. OOIMcf to reflect current costs for new facilities in remote areas as well as for new Jones-Act ships. Also, the value of gas production decreased because of the current assumption regarding the gas price btu-discount. In the 2006 assessment, a $60 oil price was correlated to a gas price of $9.07IMcf In 2008, a $60 oil price is associated with a $6.41 gas price. Thus, gas value decreased by 30% while processing and transportation costs increased to reflect present conditions. This affected the economic simulations for both gas and oil prospects. Gas prospects that were marginal in the 2006 assessment became uneconomic in the current assessment, and the value of oil prospects were negatively affected when oil and gas are co-developed.
The data is presented as being ""as of July 2010"". Does that mean that the numbers in there do not reflect the current situation?

MMS Response: No, the ""as of July 2010"" statement means that the leased and unleased portions of the UTRR's are estimated to reflect what would be available for lease at the start of the new program (July 2010). As you know, this date has now slipped but that will not have a significant impact on the leased and unleased numbers.

2. What is the status of the second hydrate drilling initiative that was planned for 2008 (p. 12)? Did that go off as planned? No. Drillship availability was being pushed into hurricane season so the cruise was delayed until spring 2009 to maximize the chance for a successful endeavor. 3. Was there any criteria used to define BP, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell as the ""major"" companies in the Gulf? This is described on page 14 as ""In this report, we define major companies to include BP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and Shell. The grouping of these four entities does not indicate a regulatory conclusion or an analysis of production size. It is merely a convenient category for the purpose of comparison."" These larger companies, with greater resources to draw on, tend to focus on larger resources that may take greater capital to develop than smaller independents can consider. This distinction simply makes a convenient way to capture the differences in company philosophy that tends to be seen in bidding patterns. 4. On page 20, there is a mention of 23 blocks that were forfeited by high bidders in Sale 250. Was there a reason given for those forfeitures? Companies do not have to give a reason for forfeiting the 1/5th payment on their bonus bid. Typically, a forfeiture is based on a company acquiring new information after they have placed their bid . If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally determined, the company can choose to limit thei r loss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale. 5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible. 6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement document found at http ://www.mms.gov/revaldiv/PDFs/FinallnvRptToCongress0501 06.pdf. 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers

If the new information indicates that the tract is worth less than originally determined, the company can choose to limit their loss by forfeiting the 1/5 payment. The block will then be offered again in the next sale. 5. On page 22, there's a graph (Figure 14) showing the number of new leases issued in all years by DWRRA depth categories. On page 24, there's information that 40% of the total number of leases issued in 2006 and 2007 in > 800m depths were from previously expired, terminated, or
7

relinquished leases. Can MMS provide that stat - how many of the leases were previously expired, etc. - for each of the years and depth ranges in the post-DWRRA period (so, basically, how many of each of the leases graphed in Figure 14 (from 2001 onward) come from previously expired (etc.) leases)? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible. 6. There's a lot of discussion about additions to reserves, but there's no discussion of what the actual reserve numbers are or how they've changed. The most recent figure I have is from the 2006 assessment: 7.06 billion barrels in reserves. How has that number changed over time, and what is the most recent figure? The most recent information is reported on page 31 of the resource assement document found at http://www.mms.gov/revaldiv/PDFs/FinallnvRptToCongress0501 06.pdf. 7. I would like to get more detail into Figure 56 (p. 78) - can MMS provide the exact numbers from 1985 onward that were used to generate this graph? And can MMS provide similar numbers for all leases in the GOM? This inquiry requires our program folks are determining if we can provide this information and if so, how long it will take to do so. We will get back to you as soon as possible. Julie S.

This program authorizes allocation of $250 million annually to AL, AK, CA, LA, MS and TX, for 4 years -- FY 2007 through FY 2010. MMS calculated individual State allocations for FY 2007 and 2008 based on annual revenues for FY 2006. Allocations for FY 2009 and 2010 will be based on annual revenues for FY 2008. Individual awards are granted after the approval of a final plan by each State. California's ClAP Allocation for FY 2007 and FY 2008 is $7,444,441.

Dave, please see our responses to the questions you presented last week. We have requested information from CA for production and revenue statistics for State waters. If you need additional assistance, please let us know. Lyn Herdt MMS Office of Congressional Affairs 202 208-3828

Question 1: Was the spill from a platform in Federal waters or state waters (and if in state waters, was it permitted by the State of California)? Is there still oil/gas production occurring in California State waters? The 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill occurred in Federal waters from Federal Platform A, approximately 5.8 miles from land.

Question 2: Is there still oil/gas production occurring in California State waters? Yes, there is production occurring in California State waters, under the jurisdiction of the CA Department of Conservation; Division of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources, and there is also production occurring in Federal waters the coast of California, under the jurisdiction of MMS. Question 3: How much oil/gas has been produced in California State waters since the Santa Barbara spill? MMS does not have production statistics for California State waters. However the CA Department of Conservation; Division of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources has production information from 1969 to the present. We contacted them requesting the information but have not heard back. We will pass that information along when we receive it. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) reports on State production by year, but the data base covers only 1981?2007. http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbbl_m.htm

Follow up Question: How much oil has been released into the Pacific OCS marine environment since the Santa Barbara Spill? Since 1970, over a million barrels of oil have been produced for every barrel spilled since 1970. Approximately 879 barrels of oil spilled into the Pacific OCS marine environment since 1970 as a result of Federal oil and gas operations. This fact is most impressive considering numerous studies that have demonstrated in the isolated location of Coal Oil Point alone over 1,000 barrels of oil seep naturally into the ocean in any given week. See Appendix C of Oil in the Sea III, pp. 189-190, estimating 140,000 barrels of oil originating from southern California seeps naturally into the ocean annually.
Question 4: How much revenue (tax revenue or other revenue directly related to oil/gas activities) has the State of California received since the Santa Barbara spill from oil/gas activities in state waters? MMS does not have revenue information from State production. However, the State of California has received a significant amount of revenue disbursements from Federal production off the coast of California. As a result of amendments to OCS Lands Act, 27% of the revenues from Federal leases in the 8(g) zone are shared with the neighboring State (referred to as 8(g) payments). The accompanying spreadsheet demonstrates the amount of revenue disbursed to California in the form of rents, royalties, or other payments as required by OCS Lands Act or other statute, law or agreement. From 1986 to 2007, the State of California received $699,532,483 in 8(g) payments. Question 5: How much Oil/gas has been produced in the all of the all offshore areas of the United States since the Santa Barbara spill? From the Federal OCS, approximately 15.9 billion barrels of oil and 167.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas has been developed and produced from 1969 through June 2008. However, MMS does not have production statistics for State waters. The EIA report found on the web link provided above in response to Question 3 provides information on State production. Question 6: Has there been any Oil/gas produced in the Federal waters off the coast of California since the Santa Barbara spill and if so, how much has been produced? Yes. From 1969 to June 2008, about 1.199 billion barrels of oil and over 1.601 trillion cubic feet of
2

natural gas have been produced from the Federal waters of the Pacific OCS Region; this production is concentrated off the coast of southern California. Question 7: How much has the Federal government received in royalty payments and revenue payments from all OCS activities in waters of the United States since the Santa Barbara spill?

LA 331 runs through the Town of Erath until it intersects with Charlie Field Road . Charlie Field Road also connects LA 14 with LA 331 . Many trucks traveling south on LA 331 use Charlie Field Road to access LA 331 from LA 14, as it is a shorter distance than the comparable path on LA 331 and they can avoid traveling through the populated area of Erath. Reconstructing this section of the roadway will improve access to the Henry Hub as well as mitigate the damages caused by the many vehicles that service Gulf of Mexico-based activities terminating at the Henry Hub.

Subject: RE: Louisiana Revenue Stats FY08

Megan, there has been no shared revenues disbursed to the GOM costal states from leases let in the EGOM, as directed by GOMESA. The statute calls for distribution in the FY following receipt of the revenues. Sale 224, held in March 2008, included the GOMESA 181 area acreage in the EGOM. Disbursement of the States' share of the revenues from that March 2008 sale is anticipated to be completed by March 31,2009. The 181 Area South is the second area GOMESA established immediate revenue sharing. This area, located in the Central GOM, will be included in the upcoming CGOM OCS Sale 208, to be held on March 18, 2009. The States' share of the revenues from this sale would be disbursed in FY 2010.

Leslie, florida reporters are asking about the secretary's comments. Following is what I'm proposing to say. Thoughts?

Sen. Nelson is aware of no new evidence that would suggest drilling off the coast of Florida would produce enough enen:,1)i to justify risking the economy and environment of the fourth largest state in the nation. He remains adamantly opposed to putting oil rigs ncar Florida' s coast. And he intends to speak with Sec. Salazar for clarification of his comments.

Subject:
Rick, you requested infonnation on Kerr-McGee lawsuit challenging the Secretary's authority to place thresholds on leases issued under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act during 1996, 1997 and 2000. Kerr-McGee has challenged the legality of oil and gas price thresholds included by MMS in lease instruments for mandatory deep water royalty relief leases issued under section 304 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. The DOl set price thresholds in the leases that require companies to pay royalty for the years in which the natural gas and crude oil price thresholds, respectively, were exceeded. On October 30, 2007, Kerr McGee (now owned by Anadarko) sued to overturn this policy. The Federal District Court (W.D. La.) granted summary judgment in favor of Kerr-McGee. The 5th Circuit upheld the lower court's decision on January 12, 2009. The Department of Justice could decide to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court in the first 90 days. MMS estimates lost royalties over the life of these leases would be approximately $23 billion in current year dollars (assuming average prices of about $81 per barrel for oil and $8.70 per thousand cubic feet for gas). Principle and interest paid through 2008 on these disputed leases and at issue for refund is estimated at $1.8 billion.

Megan, In response to your email:

1. Can you tell us what Texas currently gets in offshore revenues?
o FY08 revenue statistics for Texas are attached.

2. It is correct that state waters extend 10 miles for Texas? If this is the case, does Texas get
any revenue sharing beyond 10 miles off their coast? If so, what is that percentage? o Congress enacted two laws in 1953 that address ownership and development of offshore resources-the Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The
1

o

Submerged Lands Act granted certain offshore lands to coastal states-jurisdiction over submerged lands seaward of their coastlines to a distance of generally 3 nautical miles. States have ownership of these submerged lands and regulate the oil and gas activities within their state waters. Federal ownership begins three nautical miles off most coastal states. Exceptions are off Texas and the Gulf coast of Florida where the OCS starts at about nine nautical miles; this nine nautical mile distance was granted under the respective State's Statehood Act. The OCSLA amendments established a zone in Federal waters, 3 miles seaward from the coastal state's waters. This zone was established under section 8(g) of the DCS Lands Act, thus it is known as the ""8(g) zone"". Revenues generated from leases within this 8(g) zone are shared 27% with the adjacent coastal state. FY 2008 8(g) disbursements: $103.6 million AL $15.0 million AK $17.8 million CA $11.0 million LA $45.8 million TX $13.3 million MS $ 564,068 FL $ 83 There are two other OCS revenue sharing programs: 1) The Coastal Impact Assistant Program (ClAP), established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and 2) the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA).
ClAP. This OCS revenue sharing program was established under section 384 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and authorizes allocation of $250 million annually to AL, AK, CA, LA, MS and TX, and their coastal political subdivisions for 4 years -- FY 2007 through FY 2010. The main emphasis for funding is for projects related to coastal restoration and conservation. MMS calculated individual State allocations for FY 2007 and 2008 based on annual revenues for FY 2006. Allocations for FY 2009 and 2010 will be based on annual revenues for FY 2008. Individual awards are granted after the approval of a final plan by each State.

o

State ClAP Allocations FY 2007 and FY 2008 10.54% Alabama 1.00% Alaska 3.07% California 52.60% Louisiana Mississippi 12.76% 20.04% Texas $ 25,551,607 $ 2,425,000 $ 7,444,441 $127,547,898 $ 30,939,850 $ 48,591,202

3. Also, for all state waters for all states, is it correct that we get 100% of those (so for Louisiana, we get 100% of royalties on activity from 0 to 3 miles off our coast)? 4. Is it correct that the 8(g) zone extends 3 to 6 miles throughout the GOM? Can you send over a map that shows the 8(g) zone? Please see attached map (CGOM Program Area). This was the best map that we could find that shows those zones. If you need something better, please let me know.
2

5. And this question might be just for clarification, but beyond the 8(g} zone (3-6 miles), there is no revenue sharing with states except for what is projected to be shared from the 181 area. Is that correct?

o

GOMESA established that 37.5% of the qualified OCS revenues from new leases in two portions of the GOM -- the ""EGOM 181 Area"" and in the ""CGOM 181 Area South"" -- and 12.5% to be placed in the state-side L&WCF. Revenues (bonus bids, rentals and production royalty) will be shared with 4 GOM producing states - AL, LA, MS, TX and their coastal political subdivisions. After FY 2016,37.5% of the revenues from all leases in the GOM entered into after enactmentof GOMESA (Dec 2006) will be shared with the 4 GOM producing states. Revenue allocations to the states are based on their inverse proportional distance from applicable leases. GOMESA provides a minimum allocation of 10 percent to each state of the qualified OCS revenues distributed each fiscal year. The final GOMESA rule to implement the statute's formula and methodology for calculating and allocating the revenues to be shared was published December 23, 2008, and became effective on January 22, 2009

6. Also, the onshore development on federal lands shares 50% with states- can you give me background on why onshore receives 50%? o Mineral leasing and associated payments are governed by the Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. 181 , which provides that all states receive 50 percent of the revenues resulting from the leasing of mineral resources on federal public domain lands within their borders. With the exception of Alaska, the state receives 90 percent of revenues generated trom the leasing of mineral resources on federal public lands within its boundaries under the Mineral Leasing Act.

Jamie, BLM has informed me that there is not really a map available of all the Louisiana onshore leases, but they have provided me a 140-page document that lists all the onshore leases and where they are located in the state. There are 616 authorized leases in the State and the report includes the lease number, location description, parish, acres, effective date, and the name of lessee for each of the 616 leases. The document is 394 kb, do you think if I sent it to you, you would receive it in your house email box? Thanks so much! Lesley K.

The 101.3 billion barrels (""total endowment"" less ""cumulative production"", as you calculated) represents MMS's estimates of discovered and undiscovered resources. ""Resources"" is a more appropriate term than ""Reserves"" in this case .... You could call the 101.3 billion barrels ""untapped Federal OCS oil resources"" (keep in mind this excludes state waters). Just for clarification, you would not technically call these ""reserves"" since they include both undiscovered resources and discovered resources. Reserves are by definition discovered, economic, and have an associated development project attached to them. They are the category of resources known with the greatest certainty. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Cheri

Cheri, As we discussed, I am looking for a clarification as to whether I can use the ""total endowment"" number that MMS came up with in 2006 i.e. Reserves + reserves appreciation + mean undiscovered resources = 101.3 billion barrels total for untapped offshore oil reserves, or is it just the 85.88 billion barrels. Thanks for your clarification.

From: Herdt, Lyn Sent: Friday, March 20, 2009 11:44 AM To: Steve Feldgus (steveJeldgus@mail.house.gov); Deborah Lanzone (House Resources, Majority) Subject: FW: Hearing on 24th

This is to follow up on my discussion last week with Steve and the recent reports of the upcoming joint Subcommittee hearing focused on the environmental affects of OCS development. As you are aware, the OCS Lands Act authorized MMS's Environmental Studies Program (ESP) as a means to gather and synthesis environmental, social and economic science information. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy report, ""An Ocean Blueprint for the 21 5t Century,"" identifies the MMS ESP ""as a major source of information about the impacts of OCS oil and gas activities on the human, marine, and coastal environments."" . The Minerals Management Service's (MMS) environmental programs directly support informed decisionmaking on energy and non-energy mineral planning and development activities for the OCS. MMS is involved in all phases of OCS activity, providing comprehensive environmental analyses, environmental policy guidance, direction, and program oversight for the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management program. Key functions performed by the MMS Environmental Division include: o o o o Evaluating and analyzing environmental data necessary to prepare program-level and site specific National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and OCS Lands Act reports. Providing scientific and technical information to support decisions needed to avoid potential environmental effects of offshore energy and marine mineral resource development. Collecting and making available to the public information needed to analyze, discuss, and guide future decisions pertaining to lease sales and exploration, development, and production activities. Developing, implementing, and assessing environmental monitoring efforts to determine the extent and duration of environmental effects and potential mitigation measures that can be used to minimize impacts. Providing oversight, policy guidance, and direction for NEP A and other environmental laws and regulations affecting OCS activities; and participates in international conventions and treaty activities. Administering grants funds identified by Congress to be used to protect, conserve or restore the natural coastal environment and to mitigate impacts from offshore oil and gas activities. Assessing conformity with environmental legal mandates and regulations (e.g. the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act).

With our $800 million in studies designed to ensure sound steward and protection of the ocean environmental, MMS's Environmental Studies Program provides support to the decision-making concerning the offshore program. The ESP has 3 general goals: o o o assess and manage environmental impacts, predict potential impacts on marine life from chronic, low-level pollution or large spills; and monitor human, marine, and coastal environments.

These studies have provided significant advances in knowledge regarding marine mammals, deep water currents, and the ecology and significance of the largest artificial reef system in the world created by the oil and gas platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, these studies have resulted in discoveries such as a new species of polychaete worms, fondly known as ""ice worms,"" that actually live on the outcrops of frozen methane hydrates that occur in deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The MMS has expanded the scope of the ESP to meet information needs for the management of the oes Sand and Gravel program, and has begun acquiring information relevant to the oes Alternative Energy program focusing on renewable energy projects including wind, wave, and ocean currents. MMS also conducts research in physical oceanography that focuses on understanding and verifying general physical processes and features common to the oes The MMS is the principal US federal agency responsible for oil spill response research to fulfill oil spill regulatory responsibilities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). Responsibility to manage the National Oil Spill Response Facility ""Ohmsett"" came from OP A 90 and funding for operation and maintenance costs of the facility are covered by the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. For more than 25 years, MMS has maintained a comprehensive, long-term research program to improve oil spill response technologies. The major focus of the program is to improve the knowledge and technologies used for the detection, containment and cleanup of oil spills that may occur on the oes. The Ohmsett facility provides oil spill response testing, training, and research opportunities to government, industry, academia, and private organizations on a reimbursable basis. Ohmsett is the only facility that can test full sized oil spill response equipment with a variety of crude oils and refined petroleum products under reproducible marine conditions. MMS engages academia, industry, non-government organizations, Federal, State, and local governments outside entities in the development of a research plan for the ESP. The studies are sponsored through a competitive procurement process, cooperative agreements with State institutions and universities, and interagency agreements with other Federal Agencies. Due to the interest in study results, MMS established the Environmental Studies Program Information System (ESPIS) to provide easy access to completed studies. ESPIS can be accessed through the MMS website at: https:llwww.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/espis/espismaster.asp?appid=1. I wanted to bring to your attention to the scope ofMMS's environmental studies program. To assist the subcommittee, MMS would be pleased to offer our assistance in providing the names of distinguished subject matter experts who are familiar with the environmental issues surrounding the oes program.

Litigation on the current 5-year program was mentioned and you asked about the status. Oral arguments took place in October 2008 and we are waiting to hear back from the court. The following bullet provides a brief synopsis.

5-Year Program is subject of Litigation before the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: The Center for Biological Diversity and Native Village of Point Hope (Alaska) are Petitioners in two consolidated cases against DOl, alleging agency failures related to the OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012. MMS worked with the Solicitor's Office and DO} to conduct oral arguments on October 17, 2008. It will be 6 months or more before the Court ruling is issued.
Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks, Cheri

September 2008 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Resources by Water Depth Congress has been considering many proposals regarding oil and gas leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has received many requests for information regarding OCS resource assessments and the location of those resources in relation to the distance from the coastline. In response to these numerous requests the MMS has published several new illustrations that can be found on our website. These illustrations, one for each OCS Planning Area in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Eastern Gulf of Mexico, depict the Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Resources (UTRR) by water depth and are based on the MMS 2006 OCS oil and gas assessment data. MMS does not have UTRR data specific to distance from shore. However, lines showing distance from shore have been drawn on the illustration for purely reference purposes only to show the most common mileage increments included in recent legislative proposals. The UTRR numbers have no direct correlation to the distance from shore. The new illustrations include the following Planning Areas and can be found at: http://www.mms.govlrevaldivlNatAssessmentMap.htm Oregon-Washington Northern California Central California Southern California Eastern Gulf of Mexico Straits of Florida South Atlantic Mid Atlantic North Atlantic Other Resource Assessment information, including the source for the UTRR data can be found at: http://www.mms.gov/revaldiv/RedNatAssessment.htm For past editions ofMMS Fast Facts, visit http://www.mms.gov/ooc/newweb/congressionalaffairs/congress.htm. To find out more about MMS, visit the our website at http://www.mms.gov, or http://www.mrm.mms.gov for information on the MMS Mineral Revenue Management Program or http://www.mms.gov/offshore for information on the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Program, or call the MMS Office of Congressional Affairs at (202) 208-3502.

Sent: Thursday, March OS, 2009 2: 12 PM
To: Steve Feldgus (steveJeldgus@mail.house.gov) Cc: Hunter, Cheri; Haenny, lesley Subject: FW: Question re differences between MMS and EIA number

Steve, in response to your question re the different EIA and MMS GOM proven reserve numbers, we offer the following information about EIA reserves reporting and our Resource Evaluation Division's explanation of MMS' reserve estimates and latest data. Estimates of proved reserves are not fixed, will change over time with revisions and increase as new field discoveries are reported and decrease as reserves are produced. Therefore, the estimate of proved reserves will first depend on the date the estimate was made. The MMS estimate Mr. Felgus cites (7.06 Bbbls of oil) for Gulf of Mexico Reserves probably came from Table 1(a) of the Inventory Report which consists of both Remaining Proved Oil Reserves of 5.71 Billion Bbls and 1.35 Billion Bbls of Unproved Reserves as of December 31 st, 2002. (Generally, the unproved reserves are not added to proved reserves because of different levels of economic certainty and hydrocarbon assurance. However, MMS combined these estimates for the purposes of the Inventory report. ) The EIA estimate of 5 Billion Bbls appears to consist only of remaining Proved Oil Reserves. EIA would need to confirm the source of their 5 Bbbls--this may be an unpublished update of their 2007 estimate? ** MMS's report of remaining Proved Oil Reserves estimated 4.82 Billion Bbls as of December 31st, 2004. http://www.gomr.mms.gov/PDFs/2008/2008-034.pdf EIA compiles information reported to them by industry. MMS estimates come from independent interpretation of the data and are used to support our Fair Market Value determinations. MMS works with EIA on major differences between MMS' field level data and the company reported data that EIA collects, usually yearly. In summary, the difference in these estimates appear to lie in how estimates of Unproved Reserves were accounted for in the reports and the time period the estimates are made.

** EIA's annual estimates can be found at either:

MAR -9 2lI9.
The Honorable Dianne Feinstein Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Chairman Feinstein:

lNAMERICA

This letter updates information provided to you in a February 4, 2008, letter regarding oil and gas royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA) responding to your letter of April 18,2007, to fanner Secretary Kempthorne. The information below relates to the three items you requested. 1. The current status of negotiations between the Department and the 45 companies holding 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds; a list which shows the companies that have agreed to renegotiate their leases; and the percent of the overall revenue loss that the Department attributes to each company. Currently, there are 43 companies that have record title or operating rights interest in the 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds. While we have had at least preliminary discussions with all companies that have held or currently hold significant interests, most companies appear to be waiting to see the outcome of the Kerr-McGee litigation. This Administration will continue to work with Congress to reach an appropriate resolution of this issue. The Department reached agreements with six companies (Enclosure I), and they have been paying royalties consistent with the temlS ofthe agreements. Enclosure 2 provides an update on the amount and percentage, attributed to each company, of royalties that would have been paid through December 31, 2008, if price thresholds had applied to these leases. Please note that there are some differences between Enclosures 1 and 2 because the 43 companies listed in Enclosure 1 are current lessees of record title in the 1998 and 1999 leases, whereas, the companies listed in Enclosure 2 are companies with operating rights ownership in those 1998 and 1999 leases that have been or are currently in a producing status. Under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996, companies that are designated operators are primarily liable for royalty payments once leases are in producing status. 2. The current status of the Kerr-lvfcGee legal challenge to the Department's authority to place price thresholds on any deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000; the anticipated resolution date for the case; and the Department's view on congressional legislation reaffirming the Department's authority to place price thresholds. On January 12, 2009, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion upholding the District Court and ruling in favor of Kerr-McGee. The Department of Justice is considering the Department's

2

recommendation that a motion be filed requesting the Fifth Circuit reconsider this ruling en

bane.
3. The current status of the leases and the annual anlOunt of royalties that have been foregone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases, and estimates of future foregone royalties from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases and future royalties that may be at risk from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until these issues are resolved; and the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until the Kerr-McGee suit is resolved. As requested, Enclosure 3 provides an update on the status of the leases and the annual amount ofroyaities that have been forgone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases as of December 31, 2008. Enclosure 4 outlines the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases. The annual amount of royalties increased from $1,1 billion in our February 4, 2008, letter to $1.5 billion to date. We will update these figures annually. Enclosure Sa provides a range of estimates, as of January 1, 2009, for future royalties from 1996, 1997, and 2000 D WRRA leases that may be at risk due to the KerrMcGee litigation and Enclosure 5b provides estimates of future production and royalty value from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases. The estimates range from $18 billion to $19.0 billion and $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion in current year dollars, respectively. We will continue to send you updates as new information becomes available. A copy of this letter is being sent to all Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Members. Should you or your staff have any questions) please do not hesitate to contact me by phone at (202) 208-6734.

Iproduction and royalty values have been curtailed for each lease at a maximum equal to the lease's DWRRA royalty suspension volume. 2Low and High Case production estimates are based on MMS ungrown and grown lease-level estimates of reserves and .resources, respectively. M1-.1S growth conventions have a greater effect on resources of higher certainly (proved reserves) and have less or no effeet on unproved reserves and undiscovered resOLU'ees resulting in a narrowing of the range of estimates prescribed by the low and the high cases. RoyalLy values vary between low and high cases for identical estimated resource levels depending on the timing of the corresponding estimated. production profile. High case estimates are comprised of production estimates from leases that are typically estimated 10 produce at higher rates than resources in the low case by virtue combinations of factors such as additional installed capacity, number of producing wells, and well productivity. Such effects can result in high case production OCCuriDg sooner, and at lower prices. with less rOYdlty value. JFulure prices are OMB,Revised ""Economic Assumptions for 2010 Budget"", Average Refiner's Acquisition Cost for oil and Wellhead Price for natural gas (both arc nominal price vectors and are adjusted to GOM market), Average Oil Price for all future estimated oil production = 574.72 per bbl. average gas price = $7.89 per mcf.

lproduction and royalty values have been curtailed for each lease at a maximum equal to the lease's DWRRA royalty suspension volume. lLow and High Case production estimates are based On MMS and grown lease-level estimates of reserves and resources, respectively. MMS growth conventions have a greater effect on resources of higher certainty (proved reserves) and have less or no effect on unproved reserves and undiscovered resources resulting in a narrowing of the range of estimates prescribed by the low and the high cases. Royally values vary between low and high cases for identical estimated resource levels depending on the timing of the corresponding estimated production profile. High case estimates are comprised of production estimates from leases that are typically estimated to produce at higher rates than resources in the low case by virtue combinations of factor.; such as additional installed capacity, number of producing wells, and well productivity. Such effects can result in high case production occuring sooner, and at lower prices, with less royalty value.

Average Oil !'rice for all fulure estimated oil produclion = $70.96 per bbl, average gas price = $7.40 per mcf. All future prices arc estimated to exceed the DWRRA price thresholds. 'Transportation allowances of$3 .50 per bbl of oil and SO_30 per mer of gas were assumed. SBP, ConocoPhillips, Marathon, Shell, and Walter, along with their affiliates have signed agreements with MMS to accept the price thresholds applicable to the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases. Should the court's current decision in favor of Kerr McGee stand following the appeal process, these companies may exercise their option to terminate these agreements

The attached letter from the Department of the Interior's Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, is the 2nd update to Chairman Feinstein's original April 18, 2007, request for information regarding oil and gas royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA). The update provides information on Gulf of Mexico OCS leases issued with deep water royalty relief in 1996 through 2000, including leases that were issued in 1998 and 1999 without prices thresholds and on leases issued in 1996, 1997 and 2000 which are the subject of the Kerr-McGee lawsuit, challenging the Secretary's authority under the DWRRA to set price thresholds for leases issued in 1996-2000.

Subject: RE: Status on Alabama ClAP plan
Hi Jon, Following our phone call yesterday, I am providing a little additional information at your request.

1. The State Plan that was received by the MMS Gulf of Mexico Region on March 6 does not contain the 2 projects.
The projects that were removed can be submitted at a later time. Whether or not public participation will be required will depend on the manner in which the projects are resubmitted. MMS coordinates quite closely with the State ClAP leads in advising on these processes. The Region anticipates submitting an approval package to MMS Headquarters by March 16. MMS has made a concerted effort to minimize the subsequent review/signature time, the 6 to 8 weeks includes approvals through all of the required authorities.

2.

My apologies for not being able to give you a call during normal working hours today, I wanted to send an email to let you know that we didn't forget about you. I'd be happy to discuss with you tomorrow if you would like, send me a reply if you would like to discuss further. Thanks, Cheri

Subject: Status on Alabama ClAP plan
Jon,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today. Per your request for an update on the State's ClAP plan submission:
The State submitted its revised Plan January 26, 2009. The MMS completed its review and determined that 2 projects did not meet an authorized use criteria. An email informing the State of these comments was sent February 25, 2009. The State had 10 working days (March 11, 2009) to modify and submit a final version of the Plan; the State sent a final Plan on March 6, 2009. The MMS is completing its review of the changes in the final Plan and anticipates submitting an approval package around March 16th. The MMS intends to move the plan through headquarters review and, presuming there are no additional problems, to the Acting Director for signature in 6 to 8 weeks. Please let me know if you need any additional information. Thanks, Cheri

Interior's Minerals Management Service Disburses Record $23.4 Billion in FY 2008
State share/rom energy production hits new high 0/$2.59 billion
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthome today announced that Interior's Minerals Management Service had distributed a record $23.4 billion to state, American Indian and federal accounts from onshore and offshore energy production during Fiscal Year 2008. Kempthome said the record disbursements from royalties, rents, and bonuses shattered the 2007 total of $11.6 billion, far surpassing the previous record of $12.8 billion disbursed in FY 2006. ""These funds provide a critical source of revenues that are so important to today's federal and state budgets as well as to American Indian communities across the country,"" Kempthome said. ""Particularly in today's economic environment, these revenues represent an increasingly important source of funding for many federal, state and tribal budgets,"" Kempthome noted, adding that funds disbursed to individual states and tribes support a range of projects from infrastructure improvements and capital works to funding for education. Kempthome atttibuted the record disbursements to higher energy prices during FY 2008 and the more than $10 billion in bonus bids paid by companies to lease tracts for offshore energy exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, as well as from onshore lease sales. As part of the total, a record $2.59 billion was disbursed to 35 states as their share of federal revenues collected from energy production within their borders; $17.3 billion was disbursed to the U.S. Treasury; and $534 million was disbursed to 34 American Indian Tribes and 30,000 individual American Indian mineral owners. Since it was established in 1982, MMS has disbursed more than $200 billion to federal, state, and American Indian accounts. Since 2001, a total of$89.2 billion has been dispersed, and $12.6 billion of that went to the states.

The disbursements to the states represent their cumulative share of revenues collected from energy production on federal lands within their borders, and from federal offshore oil and gas tracts adjacent to their shores. In addition, MMS funds various special use accounts, including $2 billion contributed to the Reclamation Fund for water projects; $897 million to the Land & Water Consen'ation Fund; and $150 Inillion to the Historic Preservation Fund. The $2.6 billion disbursed to 35 states in FY 2008 compares to the $1.97 billion disbursed in FY 2007, and the previous high of $2.2 billion disbursed in FY 2006. The state of Wyoming again led all states in FY 2008 by receiving more than $1.2 billion as its share of revenues collected from energy production on federal lands within its borders, including oil, gas and coal production. New Mexico followed with more than $614 million in receipts. Coastal states with producing federal offshore tracts within three miles of their state waters also receive 27 percent of royalties generated in those areas . Remaining offshore revenues collected by the Minerals Management Service are deposited in various accounts of the U.S. Treasury, including the General Fund, and to the Coastal Impact Assistant Program for states. States receiving revenues through Fiscal Year 2008 include: Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Florida Idaho Illinois Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Mexico North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania $15,836,221.38 $38,556,903.53 $266,834.26 $13,189,227.20 $103,445,963.15 $178,377,966.07 $6,298 .00 $1,978,855.53 $286,561.67 $19l.50 $2,605,367.43 $508,473.37 $49,466,635.80 $1,171,444.97 $13,030.27 $1,572,333.15 $4,561,311.95 $48,943,889.42 $40,800.27 $17,622,148.72 $614,829,204.51 $23,392,224.43 $574,971.75 $7,240,652.39 $294,100.53 $69,368.41

In addition to state disbursements, MMS disburses revenues to the county level in support of geothennal energy production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the federal government disburses 25 percent of receipts from geothermal energy production directly to counties where that production occurs. About $9.1 million was disbursed to counties in six states for the alternative energy resource in FY 2008, more than doubling the $4.3 million that was disbursed to counties the previous fiscal year. Counties receiving geothermal receipts are located in California, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. Interior's Minerals Management Service is the federal agency responsible for collecting, auditing and disbursing revenues associated with mineral leases on federal and American Indian lands, and on the Outer Continental Shelf. Disbursements are made on a monthly basis from royalties, rents and bonuses collected by the MMS.

George,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today. We clarified that you would like both the number of platforms and the rig count on the OCS. As I mentioned, the number of platforms on the OCS:
Gulf of Mexico 3,772 Pacific Region 23 Total OCS 3,795 The attachment contains the number of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico Region. There are no rigs in the Alaska Region. In the Pacific, there are no Mobil Drilling Units, although there are drilling rigs on the platforms to perform development drilling or workovers. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. For some reason this email wants to double space when I hit the return, regardless of what I try. So I've included my contact information on one line below. Thanks! Cheri Cheri Hunter, Minerals Management Service, cheri.hunter@mms.gov, (202) 208-3788.

Independence Project
The Independence Project, located in the ultra-deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, is a $2 billion development designed to bring previously stranded natural gas reserves to energy consumers in the United States. Through the collaborative efforts of Enterprise Products Partners, Helix Energy Solutions and four independent exploration & production companies, approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day (""SefId"") of natural gas production and transportation capacity began producing in October 2007. The natural gas produced from this project was estimated to increase the supply of natural gas in the U.S. by approximately 2% and natural gas deliveries from the Gulf of Mexico by approximately 10%. The Independence Project consists of three main components: Independence Subsea, Independence Hub and Independence Trail. The Independence Hub facility, which is 80 percent-owned by affiliates of Enterprise, and 20 percent-owned by Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc., is a state of the art 105-foot deep-draft, semisubmersible platform. Enterprise, a leader in the development of midstream infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, designed, constructed and installed the Independence Hub platform. The facility is located in Mississippi Canyon block 920 in a water depth of approximately 8,000 feet. The platform is designed to process up to 1 Scfld of natural gas production from the initial 10 anchor fields, with excess payload capacity to tie-back up to nine additional subsea flowlines. Independence Hub has the longest mooring lines in the world at 2.4 miles to moor the floating platform to the seafloor. The Independence Trail Natural Gas Pipeline, which is 100 percent-owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise, is a new 134-mile, 24-inch pipeline that has the capacity to transport up to 1 Scfld of natural gas from the Independence Hub to an interconnect with Tennessee Gas Pipeline at West Delta block 68, a new platform also owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise. Independence Subsea consists of all the producer owned and operated facilities from the wells to tiebacks on the Independence Hub. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation, Dominion Exploration & Production and StatoilHydro own and operate the Independence Subsea facilities and production. The initial development of Independence Subsea includes 16 gas completions in 10 fields that are tied back subsea to the Independence Hub platform. The initial 10 anchor fields are located in the Atwater Valley (AT), Desoto Canyon (DC), Lloyd Ridge (LL), and Mississippi Canyon (MC) areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The longest subsea tie-back at Independence Hub is approximately 43 miles, but gas well subsea tiebacks can extend up to 60 to 75 miles from the host facility. The total miles of subsea flowlines associated with Independence Subsea is estimated at 210 miles. For more detailed information on the Independence Project see the Enterprise Product Partners website at www.epplp.com/projects/indProj.htm

Inspections & Compliance
Inspection Program
The MMS inspection program in the Gulf of Mexico is directed by the Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana, and five district offices that provide day-to-day review and inspection of oil and gas operations. There are 55 inspectors that go offshore every day, weather permitting. During 2008, the Gulf of Mexico Region conducted 665 drilling inspections, 3,445 production inspections, 342 workover and completion inspections, 6,722 meters inspected, and 4,465 pipeline inspections. The MMS also inspects the stockpiles of industry's equipment for the containment and cleanup of oil spills. Stockpiles are located at nine strategic sites along the Gulf Coast. The MMS also has a program to conduct unannounced drills to test spill response preparedness of operators in the Gulf of Mexico. The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1348(c)) requires MMS to conduct onsite inspections to assure compliance with lease terms, NTL's, and approved plans, and to assure that safety and pollution-prevention requirements of regulations are met. These inspections involve items of safety and environmental concern. Further information on the baseline for the inspection of lessee operations and facilities can be found in the National Potential Incident of Noncompliance (PINC) List (USDOI, MMS, 1990a). Noncompliance with checklisted requirements for specific installations or procedures is followed by prescribed enforcement actions consisting of written warnings or shutins of platforms, zones (wells), equipment, or pipelines. In the event a noncompliance is detected, the inspector takes the appropriate enforcement action as dictated by the National PINC List. If an operator is found in violation of a safety or environmental requirement, a citation is issued requiring that it be fixed within 7 days. The violation may call for the particular well component, production component, or the entire complex to be shut in. The primary objective of initial inspections is to assure proper installation of mobile units or structures and associated equipment. After operations begin, additional announced and unannounced inspections are conducted. Surprise unannounced inspections are conducted to foster a climate of safe operations, to maintain an MMS presence, and to focus on operators with a poor performance record. They are also conducted after a critical safety feature has previously been found defective. Depending on the distance from shore and other factors such as weather and proximity to other inspections, each MMS district inspector will inspect from one to three different drilling rigs or platforms per day. Aerial surveillance of additional offshore structures is conducted enroute. Annual inspections are conducted on all platforms, but more frequent inspections may be conducted on rigs and platforms. On-board inspections involve the inspection of all safety systems of a production platform. In the interest of efficient and effective utilization of inspection resources, random sampling techniques are being evaluated for the selection of specific items for inspection from the national PINC list and a production platform's component list.

Suspension of Operations
The OCSLA, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(1)), and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.10 provide for the suspension or temporary prohibition of an operation or activity when the suspension is in the national interest and when the suspension is necessary based on any of the conditions given at 30 CFR 250.1 O(a) through (c).

Cancellation of Leases
The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2)) and regulations at 30 CFR 250.12 authorize the Secretary to cancel a lease or permit if, after opportunity and notice for a hearing, he determines (1) continued activity would probably cause serious harm or damage to life, property, the environment, or national security or defense; (2) the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable time; (3) the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continued activity; and (4) the suspension has been in effect for at least 5 years or the termination of suspension and lease cancellation are at the request of the lessee.

Remedies and Penalties
Under 43 U.S.C. 1350(b) of the OCSLA, as amended, and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.200-250.206, civil penalties can be assessed for failure to comply with responsibilities under the law, a license, a permit, or any regulation or order issued pursuant to the Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 changed the way MMS will address civil penalties and remedies. Civil penalties are now issued for serious violations. If the violation is serious enough and is found to be a knowing and willful violation, MMS may recommend that the matter be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution (43 U.S.C. 1350(c)). The issuance and continuance in effect of any lease or of any assignment or other transfer of any lease shall be conditioned upon compliance with regulations issued under the OCSLA.

The Independence Project, located in the ultra-deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, is a $2 billion development designed to bring previously stranded natural gas reserves to energy consumers in the United States. Through the collaborative efforts of Enterprise Products Partners, Helix Energy Solutions and four independent exploration & production companies, approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day (""Bcfld"") of natural gas production and transportation capacity began producing in October 2007. The natural gas produced from this project was estimated to increase the supply of natural gas in the U.S. by approximately 2% and natural gas deliveries from the Gulf of Mexico by approximately 10%. The Independence Project consists of three main components: Independence Subsea, Independence Hub and Independence Trail. The Independence Hub facility, which is 80 percent-owned by affiliates of Enterprise, and 20 percent-owned by Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc., is a state of the art 105-foot deep-draft, semisubmersible platform. Enterprise, a leader in the development of midstream infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, designed, constructed and installed the Independence Hub platform. The facility is located in Mississippi Canyon block 920 in a water depth of approximately 8,000 feet. The platform is designed to process up to 1 Bcfld of natural gas production from the initial 10 anchor fields, with excess payload capacity to tie-back up to nine additional subsea flowlines. Independence Hub has the longest mooring lines in the world at 2.4 miles to moor the floating platform to the seafloor. The Independence Trail Natural Gas Pipeline, which is 100 percent-owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise, is a new 134-mile, 24-inch pipeline that has the capacity to transport up to 1 Bef/d of natural gas from the Independence Hub to an interconnect with Tennessee Gas Pipeline at West Delta block 68, a new platform also owned and operated by an affiliate of Enterprise. Independence Subsea consists of all the producer owned and operated facilities from the wells to tiebacks on the Independence Hub. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation, Dominion Exploration & Production and StatoilHydro own and operate the Independence Subsea facilities and production. The initial development of Independence Subsea includes 16 gas completions in 10 fields that are tied back subsea to the Independence Hub platform. The initial 10 anchor fields are located in the Atwater Valley (AT), Desoto Canyon (DC), Lloyd Ridge (LL), and Mississippi Canyon (MC) areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The longest subsea tie-back at Independence Hub is approximately 43 miles, but gas well subsea tiebacks can extend up to 60 to 75 miles from the host facility. The total miles of subsea flowlines associated with Independence Subsea is estimated at 210 miles.

Inspections & Compliance
Inspection Program
The MMS inspection program in the Gulf of Mexico is directed by the Regional Office in New Orleans, Louisiana, and five district offices that provide day-to-day review and inspection of oil and gas operations. There are 55 inspectors that go offshore every day, weather permitting. During 2008, the Gulf of Mexico Region conducted 665 drilling inspections, 3,445 production inspections, 342 workover and completion inspections, 6,722 meters inspected, and 4,465 pipeline inspections. The MMS also inspects the stockpiles of industry's equipment for the containment and cleanup of oil spills. Stockpiles are located at nine strategic sites along the Gulf Coast. The MMS also has a program to conduct unannounced drills to test spill response preparedness of operators in the Gulf of Mexico. The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1348(c>> requires MMS to conduct onsite inspections to assure compliance with lease terms, NTL's, and approved plans, and to assure that safety and pollution-prevention requirements of regulations are met. These inspections involve items of safety and environmental concern. Further information on the baseline for the inspection of lessee operations and facilities can be found in the National Potential Incident of Noncompliance (PINC) List (USDOI, MMS, 1990a). Noncompliance with checklisted requirements for specific installations or procedures is followed by prescribed enforcement actions consisting of written warnings or shutins of platforms, zones (wells), equipment, or pipelines. In the event a noncompliance is detected, the inspector takes the appropriate enforcement action as dictated by the National PINC List. If an operator is found in violation of a safety or environmental requirement, a citation is issued requiring that it be fixed within 7 days. The violation may call for the particular well component, production component, or the entire complex to be shut in. The primary objective of initial inspections is to assure proper installation of mobile units or structures and associated equipment. After operations begin, additional announced and unannounced inspections are conducted. Surprise unannounced inspections are conducted to foster a climate of safe operations, to maintain an MMS presence, and to focus on operators with a poor performance record. They are also conducted after a critical safety feature has previously been found defective. Depending on the distance from shore and other factors such as weather and proximity to other inspections, each MMS district inspector will inspect from one to three different drilling rigs or platforms per day. Aerial surveillance of additional offshore structures is conducted enroute. Annual inspections are conducted on all platforms, but more frequent inspections may be conducted on rigs and platforms. On-board inspections involve the inspection of all safety systems of a production platform. In the interest of efficient and effective utilization of inspection resources, random sampling techniques are being evaluated for the selection of specific items for inspection from the national PINC list and a production platform's component list.

Thunder Horse Project
Thunder Horse is the largest and most productive development project in the Gulf of Mexico with more than one billion barrels of estimated recoverable oil reserves. Discovered in January 1999 in Mississippi Canyon Block 778, BP's Thunder Horse development incorporates the largest production-drilling-quarters (PDO) semisubmersible platform in the world. The Thunder Horse facility has set a new Gulf of Mexico record by producing 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) from just seven wells. Thunder Horse is operated by BP with a 75 percent interest; with the remaining 25 percent interest owned by ExxonMobil. The Thunder Horse semi-submersible floating production facility was installed in 6,200 feet of water in Mississippi Canyon Block 778 in April 2005. The Thunder Horse project area is located approximately 156 miles southeast of New Orleans. The Thunder Horse Development Project consists of two separate but related discoveries referred to as Thunder Horse North (THN) and Thunder Horse South (THS). Four blocks in Mississippi Canyon (MC) 777, 778, 821, and 822 hold the first discovery known as Thunder Horse South. The remaining four unit blocks MC 775, 776,819, and 820 hold the discovery known as Thunder Horse North. The Thunder Horse facility is the largest semi-submersible facility in the world at 130,000 tons displacement, and it has a deck load capacity of 40,000 tons. It was designed to process 250,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and 200 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd) of natural gas. It is moored by a 16-point pre-set spread of wire/chain mooring lines. Production is from reservoirs between 14,000 to 19,000 feet (4,265 to 5,790 meters) below the seabed with reservoir pressures of 13,000 to 18,000 pounds per square inch (psi) and reservoir temperatures of 190 to 270 degrees Fahrenheit. The Thunder Horse Production-Drilling-Ouarters (PDO) allows for subsea wells to be drilled from the platform as well as processing production from the wells. Subsea wells are connected to production manifolds on the seafloor and then to the Thunder Horse PDO via riser flowlines. The combination of water depth and the high pressure/high temperature reservoir conditions required the development of new technology for wellheads, production manifolds, control systems and production risers. Most of the initial field development wells were drilled by the Transocean Discoverer Enterprise drillship, one of the most sophisticated floating drilling rigs in the world. Oil and gas are transported to existing shelf and onshore pipelines via the Proteus and Endymion oil pipeline systems and the Okeanos gas pipeline system, which are part of the Mardi Gras Transportation system, the highest capacity deepwater pipeline system ever built. For more detailed information on the Thunder Horse Project see the brochure on the BP website at www.bp.com/liveassets/bp internet/globalbp/globalbp uk english/reports and publications/ frontiers/STAGING/local assets/downloads/bpfl2p 16-25thunderpdq.pdf

Suspension of Operations
The OCSLA, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(1 )), and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.10 provide for the suspension or temporary prohibition of an operation or activity when the suspension is in the national interest and when the suspension is necessary based on any of the conditions given at 30 CFR 250.1 O(a) through (c).

Cancellation of Leases
The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2)) and regulations at 30 CFR 250.12 authorize the Secretary to cancel a lease or permit if, after opportunity and notice for a hearing, he determines (1) continued activity would probably cause serious harm or damage to life, property, the environment, or national security or defense; (2) the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable time; (3) the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continued activity; and (4) the suspension has been in effect for at least 5 years or the termination of suspension and lease cancellation are at the request of the lessee.

Remedies and Penalties
Under 43 U.S.C. 1350(b) of the OCSLA, as amended, and regulations appearing at 30 CFR 250.200-250.206, civil penalties can be assessed for failure to comply with responsibilities under the law, a license, a permit, or any regulation or order issued pursuant to the Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 changed the way MMS will address civil penalties and remedies. Civil penalties are now issued for serious violations. If the violation is serious enough and is found to be a knowing and willful violation, MMS may recommend that the matter be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution (43 U.S.C. 1350(c)).

Lynnel, Attached is a final agenda for the trip on June 29 and 30. The weather forecast as of now for both Monday and Tuesday indicates partly cloudy skies (only 10 to 20% chance ofrain) with high temperatures in the low to mid 90s. IfMMS has to delay the offshore trip until Tuesday (not likely as of now) we will start the agenda at least a half-hour earlier and compress the schedule to meet the visitors schedule to be at the airport by 3 :00 p.m. Please remind all the members of your group of guidance of natural fiber clothes need to be worn for the offshore trip. We suggest jeans and cotton shirt; please stick to natural fibers to ensure clothing meets Departmental requirements. MMS will supply flight helmets, hard hats, steel-toed shoes, and other safety equipment that is needed. Although we anticipate the offshore trip staying on schedule for Monday, it might be worthwhile to have a point of contact in case the schedule needs to be altered. Mike Prendergast is willing to make contact with whomever you designate. In case someone in your group needs to contact Mike, his cell phone is (504) 799-9845.

Lynnel, at your request we have revised the agenda for the MMS presentation on Tuesday, with the day starting one-half hour earlier and ending at noon. MMS will be unable to provide lunch in-house because the Gulf Office will be in the middle of a move within the building. Because the new conference room will not yet be furnished and the old conference room will be stripped out, the morning presentations will be held in the Visualization Room and food and drink are not allowed in that room. MMS will provide transportation somewhere for everyone to get lunch and then get the group to the next local location on your schedule. We look forward to receiving a list of participants. Thank you, Lyn Herdt MMS, Chief Office of Congressional Affairs 208-3502 (office)

Lynnel, good morning . When you have a minute to review this information please give me a call at 208-3828. Attached is the proposed itinerary and some background information on the Independence Project and the MMS inspection program, for the upcoming trip to the Gulf. Due to the need for the party to be at the New Orleans airport by 3:00 pm on Tuesday, we have moved the offshore tour to Monday morning and the briefing sessions on Tuesday. This will allow the full itinerary for the offshore trip, including a fly over of the LOOP on the return flight, MMS has asked for approval to fly over the LOOP facility. If there is inclement weather on Monday, the schedule will flip and the briefings will be held Monday and the offshore trip Tuesday. If the offshore trip does move to Tuesday, the itinerary will need to be shortened in order for the party to get to the airport by 3:00pm. This will most likely result in elimination of the fly over of the LOOP facility .
MMS requests a full list of the participants as soon as possible . In addition, BP management, operator of the Discoverer Enterprise drillship, requires a precautionary review of all offshore visitors relative to the issues with the H1 N1 Flu. And lastly, is Representative Scalise inviting any members of the media to participate in this trip? Look forward to speaking with you,

Compliance with the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act for Geological and Geophysical Activities on the Atlantic oes
How would we comply with the Endangered Species
Act? Section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that all Federal agencies consult with the Secretary of Commerce or Interior (via the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)) to ensure that any ""agency action"" is not likely to

Photo: NOAA (www.nmfs.gov).

(1) jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or (2) result in the destruction or adverse modification of an endangered or threatened species' critical habitat. Any proposed geological and geophysical (G&G) activity on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf that may affect or take a listed species or designated critical habitat whether the effects are beneficial, adverse, direct, or indirect, will require consultation with NMFS and FWS. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) will initiate this consultation with a Biological Assessment, or similar document, containing a thorough analysis of potential effects to ESAlisted species and designated critical habitat, a review of the best available relevant information, and any details on measures meant to minimize or eliminate the potential for effects to occur. The NMFS and FWS will review this information, consult with MMS, and then issue a Biological Opinion on whether the proposed action is likely to adversely affect or jeopardize the continued existence of the species or adversely modify critical habitat. This opinion will also include (1) an analysis of cumulative effects; (2) reasonable and prudent alternatives (if a jeopardy conclusion is reached); (3) an Incidental Take Statement (ITS) authorizing, under specific conditions, the taking of ESA-listed species; and (4) any required or recommended measures to reduce the amount or potential for incidental take. The ITS will not be issued for ESA-listed marine mammals until an authorization is obtained under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (see below). The Federal regulations implementing Section 7(a) are found at 50 CFR 402 (Interagency Cooperation - Endangered Species Act of 1973, as Amended). In addition, NMFS and FWS jointly issued an Endangered Species Consultation Handbook that addresses the major consultation processes, including informal, formal, emergency, and special consultations, and conferences. A more in-depth description of this consultation process may be found at the following MMS website: http://vvVolw.mms .gov/eppdicompliancc/csa/consultations.htm.

How would we comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act? Congress enacted the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) in 1972 (16 US.c. 1361-1407). The MMPA prohibits (with some exceptions) (1) the ""taking"" of marine mammals in U.S. waters and by any person under US. jurisdiction on the high seas and (2) importing marine mammals and marine mammal products into the US. ""Take"" is statutorily defined as ""to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture or kill any marine mammal."" The 1994 Amendments to the MMP A further define harass as ""any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance that has the potential to o o injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild (Level A); or disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by disrupting behavioral patterns (for example, migration breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering) (Level B).""

Section 101(a)(5) (A-D) ofthe MMPA, as amended (16 US.c. 1371 (a)(5)), provides a mechanism for allowing, upon request, the ""incidental,"" but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by US. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographic region provided the takings would be (1) small in numbers, (2) have no more than a ""negligible impact"" on marine mammals, and (3) have no ""unmitigable adverse impact"" on subsistence harvests of these species. These ""incidental take"" authorizations, also known as Incidental Harassment Authorizations or Letters of Authorization, outline the following: o o o permissible methods and the specified geographical region of taking; means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species or stock and its habitat and on the availability of the species or stock for ""subsistence"" uses; and requirements for monitoring and reporting, including the independent peer review of proposed monitoring plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.

As a matter of policy, MMS coordinates with NMFS and FWS to ensure that offshore operators comply with the MMP A and to identify mitigation and monitoring requirements, and other best practices that reduce the potential for take, for permits or approvals for G&G activities. A descriptive summary of the MMP A compliance process may be found at the following MMS website: http://www.mms.Q.ov/eppd/compliance/mmpa/index.htm.

National Environmental Policy Act Compliance for Geological and Geophysical Activity on the Atlantic OCS
Purpose

An environmental impact statement (ElS) is proposed in light ofthe multiple geological and geophysical (G&G) permits submitted to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) for the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) waters of the Atlantic. This EIS will evaluate the environmental impacts of these proposed G&G activities. No National Environmental Policy Act (NEP A) programmatic documents have been performed for G&G activities in the Atlantic OCS. Previous NEP A programmatic documents for G&G activities in the Gulf of Mexico have been performed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Oapl/lftMn'alrflelttteno-t .r,rlt;;l Management Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Geological Survey. The EIS proposed for the Atlantic may now be necessary not only because of the multiple permits received by MMS but also because of j ! industry's expressed interest in expanding activities into the \ "" Atlantic offshore waters. This EIS will also review \. /1 advances in G&G technology and improved knowledge of ,/ .I"",,, , ,_, __ acoustic impacts on marine life. This EIS will determine ! whether significant impacts to Atlantic resources could I occur as a result of G&G activities and, where needed, // :./ outline mitigation and monitoring measures that will reduce or eliminate the potential for impacts to the environment.

National Environmental Policy Act Compliance

Bound.lries

The NEPA of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) is the foundation of environmental policymaking in the United States. The NEP A process is intended to help public officials make decisions based on an understanding of environmental consequences and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment. The NEP A established two primary mechanisms for this purpose:
AdrniniS"" uatrve Boundancs

""""""

(1) The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was established to advise agencies on the environmental decisionmaking process and to oversee and coordinate the development of Federal environmental policy. (2) Agencies must include an environmental review process early in the planning for proposed actions.

The CEQ issued regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508) in 1978 implementing NEP A. The regulations include procedures to be used by Federal agencies for the environmental review process. Refer to the following CEQ NEP Anet website for additional guidance for implementing NEP A and for links to other websites dealing with environmental impact assessment: http://v,?v,'w.mms.gov/eppd/compli;:mcc/nepaiindcx.htm. In accordance with NEP A, MMS prepares environmental documents on various actions related to offshore energy and mineral collection activities. These documents may be environmental assessments or EIS' s, depending on the nature of the action in question or the significance of potential impacts associated with the action. It is the MMS' s policy to involve the public in preparing and implementing its NEPA procedures.

Descriptions of Geological and Geophysical Activities
Regulatory authority for geological and geophysical (G&G) surveys are authorized by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCS Lands Act); (Title 43, Chapter 29, Subchapter III, ?1340); 30 CFR 250 Subpart B (onlease); 30 CFR 251(exploration); and 30 CFR 280 (minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur). The following are descriptions of potential G&G activities associated with oil and gas, as well as non'-mineral resources (sand and gravel), and alternative energy activities. These activities include the various G&G. exploration techniques currently being used in other areas and expected to be employed in the future by operators in the Atlantic OCS. Particular attention is paid to seismic techniques, especially the role of seismic sources (e.g., airguns). Seismic surveys have historically covered large areas of the OCS each year and have the potential for ""significant"" impacts on the environment, unless mitigation and monitoring measures to reduce or eliminate impacts to the environment are applied. Further, there are increasing concerns in the regulatory and scientific communities regarding acoustic impacts on marine life, including marine mammals, turtles, and fishes. Therefore, seismic surveys are described first, followed by the other techniques. High-Resolution Seismic Data. High-resolution site surveys collect data using electrically generated acoustic sources from 140 to 210 decibels (dB) that are reflected from sediments near the seafloor surface to several kilometers or more below the seafloor. They are used for various reasons - to investigate potential geohazards and soil conditions, to identify potential benthic biological communities (or habitats) and archaeological resources, or to a lesser degree for exploration purposes. Such high-resolution data may be used for initial site evaluation for drilling rig emplacement and for platform or pipeline design and emplacement. They can also be used for the identification of potential sand resources for coastal restoration. High-resolution site survey data obtained at greater depths below the seafloor can be used for exploration purposes. Deep-Penetration Seismic Surveys. Deep-penetration seismic exploration and development surveys are conducted to obtain data on geological formations from the sediment near-surface to several thousand meters deep (below the sediment surface). A survey vessel will tow a lowfrequency acoustic source (usually high-pressure airgun arrays) that penetrates several thousand feet in the earth's subsurface and are then refracted to surface receivers, either towed in the water column or placed on the ocean bottom. These acoustic sources are generated by airguns, generating compressed air bubbles, and are generally in the 225- to 260-dB range for airgun arrays. This information enables industry to accurately assess potential hydrocarbon reservoirs and helps to optimally locate exploration and development wells, maximizing extraction and production from a reservoir. In two-dimensional or three-dimensional seismic surveys, the receivers (hydrophones) are on streamer cables towed behind the survey vessel at a depth of 5 to

10 meters (m) below the surface of the water. Individual streamers can be up to 12 kilometers (km) in length or, on rare occasions, even longer. Tail buoys with radar reflectors and strobe lights are used to mark the end of the streamers and make them more visible and/or detectable to other vessels. Alternatively, receivers may be deployed on the seafloor as bottom cable surveys or remotely-operated vehicle positioned ""nodes."" When conventional 3D ship surveys or bottom cable surveys are repeated at the same location over time, these are referred to as 4D or timelapse surveys. Another method of determining downhole seismic through the wellbore involves vertical cables with receivers suspended within wellbores and an external source used in the water column, usually by another vessel or a source hung over the rig. Deep-Tow, Sidescan-Sonar Surveys. Deep-tow, sidescan-sonar surveys are conducted in the Gulf of Mexico primarily for engineering studies involving the placement of production facilities and pipelines. These surveys provide information on the presence of sand flows, hydrates, and seeps, as well as bottom topography (e.g., hard bottom). Operations are conducted from ships towing cables up to 7 km long, which enables operations in water depths up to 3,000 m deep. Close to the end of the cable is a 30- to 45-m long section of chain to keep the sensor package (fish) tracking at approximately 25-30 m above the bottom. To do this requires the chain to be dragged along the seafloor, causing an approximately 10 centimeter (cm) wide by 15 cm deep (4 inch wide by 6 inch deep) trench to be cut in the seafloor. In situations where the chain can become entangled in shipwrecks, well heads, or other obstructions or where reef colonies live, the chain is removed, and the sensor package is kept above the seafloor by adjusting the length of the tow cable. Maintaining a constant elevation above the seafloor by adjusting the cable length is very difficult, and the elevation above the seafloor is somewhat greater in this case. Electromagnetic Surveys. Electromagnetic surveys are used to help delineate potentia] oil and gas reservoirs. Many geological processes in the crust and upper mantle of the seafloor involve the interaction of fluid phases with surrounding rock. The conductivities of hydrothermal phases are different from those of host rock, and collectively they offer distinct profiles of electrical conductivity/resistivity depending on the specific geological process involved. Magnetotelluric surveys are passive measurement of the earth's electromagnetic fields. Additionally, controlled source electromagnetic surveys, sometimes referred to as seabed logging, induce very lowfrequency (typically less than 2 hertz) electromagnetic signals into the upper layers of the seafloor via a towed dipole. The signals are propagated laterally to an array of receivers kilometers away. The variations in the electromagnetic field relative to the geometry ofthe receiver arrays and distance provide a conductivity/resistivity profile of the seafloor. From the profile, hydrocarbon reservoirs can be differentiated from water reservoirs and surrounding rock. Geological and Geochemical Sampling. Geological and geochemical sampling is conducted to obtain samples of the seafloor for physical and/or chemical analyses. Physical analyses are used in engineering studies for the placement of structures such as platforms and pipelines. Chemical analyses (surface geochemical prospecting) are based on the premise that upward migrated petroleum from deep source rocks and reservoirs can be detected in near-surface sediments and are used to evaluate exploration potential.

Bottom sampling involves devices that penetrate only a few centimeters to several meters below the seafloor. Samples of near surface sediments are typically obtained by dropping a piston core or gravity core (""dart""), essentially a weighted tube, to the ocean floor and recovering it with an attached wire line. Samples can also be obtained using a grab, which is a device with a jaw-like mechanism, or with a dredge, which is a wire cage dragged along the seafloor. Shallow coring is done by conventional rotary drilling equipment from a drilling barge or boat. Penetration is usually limited to the recovery of several feet of consolidated rock. Usually, a program of bottom sampling and shallow coring is conducted simultaneously using a small marine drilling vessel. Surface geochemical prospecting is a petroleum exploration technique based on the premise that upward migrated petroleum from deep source rocks and reservoirs can be detected in nearsurface sediments and used to evaluate exploration potential. In deepwater exploration, a crucial and arguably the most critical single issue is whether oil has been generated and, if it has, what can be determined, before making costly decisions, regarding the quality, maturity, and age of the source succession. Fortunately, since oil and gas accumulations are invariably leaky, surface geochemical exploration can be used to recover and type migrant hydrocarbons in the initial exploration phases. Remote Sensing. Radar imaging is currently used to detect oil slicks on the sea surface. This is possible because, when the oil molecules reach the sea surface, they form a thin layer that dampens the ocean surface capillary waves. The detection of oil slicks requires quiet water conditions and consequently is limited by sea state as well as by satellite position and frequency of coverage. Aeromagnetic Surveys. Aeromagnetic surveys are conducted in the Gulf of Mexico to look for deep crustal structure, salt-related structure, and intrasedimentary anomalies. The surveys are flown by twin-engine, fixed-wing aircraft, typically Cessna 404 or 208, Piper Aerostar, or Navajos. The flight lines are on the order of 400 km long, are at a height of75-150 m above the surface, and areflown at speeds of about 220 kmlhour. Gravity Surveys. Marine gravity data can be collected with instruments on the seafloor, in boreholes, in ships, or in helicopters. Data were originally collected on the seafloor, but modem technology has moved the collection point to ships. Marine gravity meters have, in some cases, been housed in a ship while it is conducting a seismic survey. However, the preferred method has been to use dedicated ships (about 50 m long) in order to acquire more precise data. With the advent of global positioning systems navigation systems and larger, more stable seismic ships, it is now possible to achieve the same order of accuracy with meters placed in seismic ships as in dedicated ships. Data grids for gravity surveys range from 1.6 km by 8 km to 9.7 km by 32 km. Marine Magnetic Surveys. Marine magnetic surveys measure the earth's magnetic field for the purpose of determining structure and sedimentary properties of subsurface horizons. These surveys are usually conducted in conjunction with a seismic survey, allowing the navigation information to be used for both surveys. The development of low-power digital sensors has allowed the sensor package to be towed behind the seismic source array, which has greatly improved the operational efficiency of magnetic surveys.

Atlantic oes Geological and Geophysical Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is preparing a programmatic environmental impact statement (PElS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.c. 4321-4347) to evaluate the potential environmental effects of multiple geological and geophysical (G&G) exploration activities on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The NEP A is the foundation of environmental policymaking in the United States. The NEP A process is intended to incorporate the best available information and stakeholder input to help public officials make decisions based on an understanding of environmental consequences and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment for actions they authorize. The G&G surveys provide information used by the offshore energy industry and government to evaluate the potential for offshore oil, gas, and methane hydrate resources and geologic hazards. Industry needs accurate data on the location, extent, and properties of hydrocarbon resources, as well as information on shallow geologic hazards and seafloor geotechnical properties, in order to explore, develop, produce, and transport hydrocarbons safely and economically. The MMS also needs this information to fulfill its statutory responsibilities to ensure that the G&G data needed by industry and government are obtained in a p U.S.De al1me""rOI'lte/n'<:rlor 'technically safe and environmentally sound IVIV/S Minerai. Mam'gmenl S.nne. I. manner, pursuant to regulations in 30 CFR 250, 251, and 281. The proposed PElS will evaluate the environmental impacts of multiple G&G activities in oes waters of the Atlantic. No NEPA programmatic documents have been performed for MMS-authorized G&G activities in the Atlantic oes. The PElS is proposed for the Atlantic oes in light of multiple permits received by MMS and industry's expressed interest in expanding activities into the Atlantic offshore waters. This PElS will determine whether significant impacts to Atlantic resources could occur as a result of G&G activities and, where needed, will outline mitigation and monitoring measures that will reduce or eliminate the potential for impacts to the environment. The NEP A process will begin with a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a PElS published in the

;'(y-

Allantic OCS Planning Area Soundaries and AcministralivB 8ouI1daries

Federal Register. Included in the NOI is a call for interest for future industry G&G activity on the Atlantic OCS. Information collected from the G&G industry will be used to develop the action area and activity level to be evaluated under this PElS and may include the entire Atlantic OCS or only portions of it. Through the NEP A process, MMS will also hold public scoping meetings on the PElS to solicit comments from stakeholders on the scope of the PElS, identify significant issues to be analyzed in the PElS, and identify possible alternatives to a proposed action. More information on the dates and locations of the scoping meetings will be published in the Federal Register in the near future.

In addition to NEPA, G&G activities must also comply with several other environmental statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, MagnusonStevens Fishery and Conservation Management Act, and Coastal Zone Management Act. These statutes all require further coordination and consultation, and in some cases authorization, with several agencies on specific environmental issues (e.g., effects to threatened and endangered species, marine mammals, essential fish habitat, benthic resources, and coastal zones).

Atlantic Geological and Geophysical Survey Regulatory Authority
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is responsible for overseeing all activities associated with mineral resource development on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), including assessment, leasing, exploration, development, production, and royalty management. Geological and geophysical (G&G) activities aimed at mineral exploration are subject to a complex series of permits and notices. The MMS Resource Evaluation Program oversees G&G data acquisition and permitting activities, pursuant to regulations at 30 CFR 250, 251, and 281. Specifically, these regulations include (1) Part 251 - regulating prelease G&G exploratory operations for oil, gas, and sulfur resources; and (2) Part 280 - regulating pre lease prospecting activities. Postlease G&G activities are governed by regulations at 30 CFR 250 and by applicable Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTL's). Other regulations also pertain to one or more of the issues considered in this analysis (e.g., the President's Council on Environmental Quality, guidelines for implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act, and pertinent regulations administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service). The purpose of the MMS regulatory program is to ensure that the G&G data needed by industry and government are obtained in a technically safe and environmentally sound manner. The MMS regulations at 30 CFR 251 mandate that G&G activities may not interfere with or endanger operations under any lease. Operations overseen and permitted by MMS must comply with various environmental laws (e.g., Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act).

Uses of Geological and Geophysical Survey Data
Geological and geophysical (G&G) surveys provide infonnation used by industry and government to evaluate the potential for offshore oil, gas, and methane hydrate resources and geologic hazards. The oil and gas industry needs accurate data on the location, extent, and properties of hydrocarbon resources, as well as infonnation on shallow geologic hazards and seafloor geotechnical properties, in order to explore, develop, produce, and transport hydrocarbons safely and economically. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) also needs this infonnation to fulfill its statutory responsibilities to ensure safe operations, support environmental impact analyses, protect benthic and archaeological resources through avoidance measures, ensure fair market value for leases, make royalty relief detenninations, conserve oil and gas resources, and perfonn other statutory responsibilities. The MMS regulatory staff specifically uses G&G data to ensure that the proposed site of bottomfounded structures is safe (i.e., via geohazards review) and that the foundations are properly designed (i.e., based on engineering parameters detennined from cores), thus ensuring safe operations. The MMS environmental staff uses these G&G data in complying with various environmental laws, such as the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and to support mitigation measures and decisions to protect benthic, historic archaeological, and other natural resources. The MMS resource evaluation staff uses deep twodimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) seismic data for resources estimation and bid evaluation to ensure that the Government receives a fair market value for tracts offered. The MMS production and development staff uses 2D, 3D and four-dimensional seismic data to map reserves and to develop evaluations for conservation of resources.

Patty On January 21, MMS published a Notice of Intent to prepare an Atlantic area G&G EIS; the comment period closed on March 23. We currently have 9 seismic permit applications filed by 5 different companies that have at least some coverage over much of the Atlantic Region. The EIS would generate the NEP A coverage so that decisions can be made on these applications. The time frame to complete the EIS would be around 2 years. The oil and gas industry is considering funding the EIS, Attached here are a number of G&G information sheets. It's a lot of information; please note the first attachment responding to your questions yesterday regarding MMS' s G&G regulatory program. If you have any questions or need additional information, please let us know.

Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 208 Attracts $ 703,048,523 in High Bids
New Orleans, LA - Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced that the Central Gulf of Mexico Oil and Gas Lease Sale 208, held today in New Orleans, attracted $703,048,523 in high bids. The sale was conducted by Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) and had 70 companies SUbmitting 476 bids on 348 tracts comprising over 1.9 million acres offshore Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The sum of all bids received totaled $ 933,649,315 . ""Today's lease sale will help us make a wise addition to our nation's energy supply,"" said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. ""The responsible energy development resulting from today' s sale will be a part of our nation's comprehensive energy plan, which will include a renewed emphasis on conservation and an aggressive effort to develop our renewable energy resources, so we can move our nation toward energy independence."" The highest bid received on a tract was $ 65,611 ,235 submitted by Shell Gulf of Mexico Inc. for Mississippi Canyon, Block 721.
2

There was a total of 13 tracts receiving bids in the ""181 South Area"" of the Central Gulf of Mexico, Salazar noted, and the high bids for these tracts totaled $6,476,545. The states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas will share in 37.5 percent of the high bids on these tracts as well as all future revenues generated from this acreage leased today in the ""181 South Area."" The enhanced revenue sharing program was mandated by the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. In addition, 12.5 percent of revenues from the ""181 South Area"" tracts will be deposited into the Land and Water Conservation Fund for use by states to enhance parklands and for other conservation projects. Each high bid on a tract will go through an evaluation process within MMS to ensure the public receives fair market value before a lease is awarded. Sale statistics for Central Sale 208 are posted on the MMS website at http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/lsesale/208/cgom208.html

Patty and Derek, There is a fairly sizable number of companies that hold interest in OCS leases. The list includes small companies and individuals that have holdings in only one lease to large companies that have holdings in hundreds of leases; and some interest owners are non-oil and gas companies/entities such as insurance and real estate trusts. 1. 2. The number of companies holding OCS leases in the GOM The number of companies holding OCS leases in the OCS 421 444

Our folks are working on the list of companies with interest in leases obtained from GOM sales held in 1996, 1997, and 2000 . There are 178 non producing leases and 79 producing or producible leases that were issued in 1996, 1997 and 2000 . While the royalty program tracks the leases once a lease begins to produce, we have had to data mine for the interest owners of the non producing leases. We will need to have this full list for the 1996, 1997 and 2000 lease interest owners before we can determine how many companies do not have an interest in leases from 1996 - 2000. I am hoping we will have this information for you if not today, early this week.

The first attachment is the latest update provided to Chairman Feinstein on the 98/99 and Kerr McGee. Enclosure # 1 to the Feinstein letter lists the companies which have signed price threshold agreements for their 98/99 lease(s) and those companies who have not.

Walter and Lyn -- Do you have a list of companies holding DWRRA leases compared to all lessees on the OCS (in the GOM and the entire OCS)? What is the universe of OCS lessees that do not hold a DWRRA lease issued in 1996-2000? Is there any update on the status of the Anadarko/Kerr McGee litigation? Is the Government likely to apply for cert.? Thanks! Patty

We focused on the FY 2010-2014 period as indicated in your discussion on Friday. We also separated the estimates by applicable region. The first sale covered by these projections is in the western GOM, held in late FY 2009, with bid acceptances assumed to occur after September 30, 2009. Please let us know if there are any questions on the estimates. Cheri Hunter's email is down; mine is still running.

Table B gives the leasing revenues (royalties plus bonuses for this discussion) that are estimated to be generated from leases issued in potential lease sales held in the draft proposed program planning areas. The total leasing revenues for all proposed sales sum to $368 billion in nominal dollars and $56 billion in present value dollars. (Cash flows are discounted at a 7 percent real interest rate plus the inflation rate to obtain present values.) Table B also gives the states' potential shares of the leasing revenues by applicable region, assuming the same revenue sharing formula of 37.5 percent as in GOMESA. They sum to $123 billion in nominal dollars and $18 billion in present value dollars, excluding revenues distributed under section 8(g) of the Act. Based on the projections of net economic value, the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars. It is assumed that Congress enacts legislation under which all leasing revenues with the states will be shared at 37.5 percent under future legislation, for areas where no sales were included in the 2007-2012 program and which were previously under moratoria. Sales in areas already included in the 2007-2012 leasing program are assumed to share revenues only as provided by GOMESA. That is, sharing begins in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico for revenues starting in FY 2017, except certain parts of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico formerly included in the Lease Sale 181 area or due south of that area, where sharing started in 2008. The estimates provided do not take account of the $500 million annual cap on revenue sharing currently provided in GOMESA for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico planning areas.

Notes: Estimates assume revenue sharing occurs without annual revenue sharing caps (currently $500 millionlyr in the GOM) Estimates assume legislation granting immediate revenue sharing for States near formerly restricted plmming areas; GOM States share royalties after 2017 Estimates assume that legislation granting revenue sharing for Atlantic and Pacific States also grants same terms for Alaska.

The study is a literature review. Although the title of the study specifically mentions Elasmobranchs (i.e. sharks and rays) one of the tasks of the project is to compile existing information on electrosensitive or magnetosensitive marine species. Lobsters and benthic organisms will not be excluded . Given the economic importance of lobster, there will be a Significant effort to compile any existing information available regarding the effects of EMF on this species .

Table B gives the leasing revenues (royalties plus bonuses for this discussion) that are estimated to be generated from leases issued in potential lease sales held in the draft proposed program planning areas. The total leasing revenues for all proposed sales sum to $368 billion in nominal dollars and $56 billion in present value dollars. (Cash flows are discounted at a 7 percent real interest rate plus the inflation rate to obtain present values.) Table B also gives the states' potential shares of the leasing revenues by applicable region, assuming the same revenue sharing formula of37.5 percent as in GOMESA. They sum to $123 billion in nominal dollars and $18 billion in present value dollars, excluding revenues distributed under section 8(g) of the Act. Based on the projections of net economic value, the sum of Federal corporate income taxes and corporate profits generated by the new program is forecasted to be an additional $1.1 trillion in nominal dollars and $130 billion in present value dollars. It is assumed that Congress enacts legislation under which all leasing revenues with the states will be shared at 37.5 percent under future legislation, for areas where no sales were included in the 2007-2012 program and which were previously under moratoria. Sales in areas already included in the 2007-2012 leasing program are assumed to share revenues only as provided by GOMESA. That is, sharing begins in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico for revenues starting in FY 2017, except certain parts of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico formerly included in the Lease Sale 181 area or due south of that area, where sharing started in 2008. The estimates provided do not take account ofthe $500 million annual cap on revenue sharing currently provided in GOMES A for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico planning areas.

Secretary Salazar Details Strategy for Comprehensive Energy Plan on U.S. Outer Continental Shelf
Provides More Time for Public Comment; Incorporates Renewable Energy
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Saying he needed to restore order to a broken process, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar today announced his strategy for developing an offshore energy plan that includes both conventional and renewable resources. His strategy calls for extending the public comment period on a proposed 5-year plan for oil and gas development on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf by 180 days, assembling a detailed report from Interior agencies on conventional and renewable offshore energy resources, holding four regional conferences to review these findings, and expediting renewable energy rulemaking for the Outer Continental Shelf. ""To establish an orderly process that allows us to make wise decisions based on sound information, we need to set aside the Bush Administration's midnight timetable for its OCS drilling plan and create our own timeline,"" Salazar said. On Friday, January 16, its last business day in office, the Bush Administration proposed a new five year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing. The proposal was actually published in the Federal Register on January 21, the day after the new Administration took office. The deadline for public comment that the Bush Administration established - March 23, 2009 - does not provide enough time for public review or for wise decisions on behalf of taxpayers, the Secretary said. ""The additional time we are providing will give states, stakeholders, and affected communities the opportunity to provide input on the future of our offshore areas,"" he said. ""The additional time will allow us to restore an orderly process to our offshore energy planning.""

Salazar said this evaluation of the proposed plan also needed better information about what resources may be available in the offshore areas. ""In the biggest area that the Bush Administration's draft OCS plan proposes for oil and gas drilling - the Atlantic seaboard, from Maine to Florida - our data on available resources is very thin, and what little we have is twenty to thirty years old,"" he said. ""We shouldn't make decisions to sell off taxpayer resources based on old information."" Salazar directed the United States Geological Survey, the Minerals Management Service, and other departmental scientists to assemble all the information available about the offshore resources - conventional and renewable - along with information about potential impacts. The report is due in 45 days. Based on that report, the Department will then determine what areas need more information and create a plan for gathering that information. The Department of the Interior oversees more than 1.7 billion acres on the Outer Continental Shelf - an area roughly three fourths of the size of the entire United States. ""To gather the best ideas for how we accomplish the task of gathering the offshore information we need, I will convene four regional meetings in the 30 days after MMS and USGS publish their report,"" Salazar said. ""I will host one meeting in Alaska, one on the Pacific Coast, one on the Atlantic Coast, and one on the Gulf Coast."" Salazar will ask all interested parties for their recommendations on how to move ahead with a comprehensive offshore energy plan. The Secretary also will build a framework for offshore renewable energy development, so that the Department can incorporate the significant potential for wind, wave, and ocean current energy into its offshore energy strategy. ""The Bush Administration was so intent on opening new , reas for oil and gas offshore that it torpedoed offshore renewable a energy efforts,"" Salazar said. As a senator, Salazar helped to craft and pass the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which required Interior to move quickly and issue, within 9 months, rules and regulations to guide the development of offshore energy resources, such as wind, wave, and tidal power. It took three years for the Bush Administration to prepare a proposed rule for offshore renewable energy development. They left office without putting any final regulations in place because it was not their priority, Salazar said, notwithstanding the requirement of the law. ""I intend to issue a final rulemaking for offshore renewables in the coming months, so that potential developers know the rules of the road,"" Salazar said. ""This rulemaking will allow us to move from the 'oil and gas only' approach of the previous Administration to the comprehensive energy plan that we need."" One interest group, and one industry, no longer runs the show at the Interior Department, Salazar said. ""To those of you from the oil and gas industry, I pledge that you will have a

seat at the table in this Administration, like everyone else, and that you will play an important role in helping us meet our nation's energy needs,"" he said. ""But President Obama and I believe that we need to be honest about our energy future. A ""drill only"" approach - onshore or offshore - isn't enough."" ""We need a new, comprehensive energy plan that takes us to the new energy frontier and secures our energy independence,"" Salazar said. ""We must embrace President Obama's vision of energy independence for the sake of our national security, our economic security, and our environmental security."" By adding the 180 day extension to the original 60-day period, interested parties will have had a total of 240 days (6 months) to comment on the proposed plan. The current comment period opened on January 21,2009.

activities and OCS plans must meet the standard of being ""consistent with"" enforceable policies. A state with an approved coastal management program (CMP) can request consistency review of a license or permit, even if not listed in their approved program, by notifying the applicant, the federal agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at the same time of its request to review (15 CFR 930.54). MMS cannot issue the permit or conduct seismic activities until every ""affected state"" that reviews the proposal determines the activity consistent with its CMP. In some OCS areas, the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires MMS to consult with NMFS on any action that may result in adverse effects to essential fish habitat. MMS has not fully implemented the requirements of these environmental laws and regulations in all 26 planning areas. For example NEPA, ESA, and MMPA multi-year coverage for Gulf of Mexico-wide seismic surveys is in progress, as is NEPA multi-year coverage for open water seismic in the Alaska Arctic. Also, separate ESA coverage for a pending Eastern Gulf of Mexico permit is needed, as is environmental coverage for the North Aleutian Basin and Atlantic planning areas. Environmental coverage for the Pacific planning areas is outdated. Time frames to implement these requirements could range from months to a few years.
If the necessary funding were made available for MMS to acquire additional seismic information, how would MMS manage the process and how much would it cost?

MMS considers approximately 23 of the 26 OCS planning areas to be frontier areas. Not everyone of these areas is believed to hold significant promise for the presence of commercial quantities of oil and gas. If MMS were directed to acquire modem seismic data in frontier areas to supplement existing data we would propose a two-phase approach. The first phase would be a reconnaissance 2-D seismic survey designed to supplement existing data. This would be the most cost effective means to refine or validate existing play concepts. This survey would then be followed up by a focused survey in the most promising portions of the planning area. A carefully targeted modern 3-D seismic survey would serve to substantially reduce geologic risks and uncertainties, refine play concepts, and identify specific exploration targets. This information would allow for more specificity in discussions regarding the number, size and possible location of prospects. However, even with this new geophysical data, only through actual exploratory drilling will there be a definitive determination of a frontier area's actual hydrocarbon potential. Prior to the actual contracting for the 2-D and 3-D phases ofthe program, MMS would consult with industry and state geological surveys regarding location priorities, design parameters, and processing requirements. Taking a typical frontier planning area, MMS would estimate that the average percentage of that area having oil and gas potential would be approximately 25%. Assuming that area to be approximately 2,000 to 2,500 blocks, we would utilize a reconnaissance 2-D

3 survey to cover that area. Assuming that 10-15% of that area is classified as being ""high potential,"" the next phase would be a focused 3-D survey covering that specific high potential area (between 200 and 375 blocks). Preliminary estimates of costs include acquisition and initial processing costs for a 2-D survey and a follow-up, focused 3-D survey, as well as mobilization, demobilization, and interpretation of such data. These estimated costs would be applied to each frontier planning area to be studied and are documented below. Typical Acquisition Costs: 2-D data acquisition - $800 line-mile 2-D data processing (initial) - $160 line-mile 3-D data acquisition - $150,000IOCS block (9 sq. mi.) 3-D data processing (initial) - $15,000IOCS block 2-D surveys are measured in terms of the length of the line traversed, hence line-miles. A 4 x 4 mile survey is composed of a regular rectangular grid of lines, each of which is 4 miles apart. For our example, a 4 x 4 mile survey covering some 2,000 blocks would require approximately 9,200 line-miles of data to be acquired. 3-D surveys are measured in terms of surface area-- either sq. mi. or blocks (9 sq. mi.). Other costs, estimated at approximately $5.5 million include mobilization, demobilization, and data interpretation. Thus, based on the acquisition and processing costs listed above, as well as an estimate of $5.5 million for mobilization, demobilization, interpretation, etc. the total estimated direct costs to acquire and process new data in a frontier area would be over $52 million to over $83 million.
In addition, certain environmental costs must be addressed, depending on the area, be it for an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS). Such costs run about $300,000 for an EA and approximately $2 million for an E1S. As previously stated, the timeframe for these documents to be completed would run from months in the case of an EA to years in the case of an EIS.

Adding these preliminary estimates of data acquisition, processing, mobilization, demobilization, and interpretation with the environmental costs for a 2-D survey and a follow-up, focused 3-D survey, the total estimated costs range from about $53 million to approximately $85 million for each frontier planning area studied. Actual survey costs could vary greatly depending upon the specific location chosen, the actual amount of data to be acquired, the location of the surveys, the availability of data acquisition vessels, data processing program design, etc. The timeframe from the initiation of necessary environmental analyses to the completion of an updated resource assessment for one frontier planning area would probably be

4

between 5 and 9 years. MMS would also require for each frontier planning area studied an additional two FTE and $300K to manage the data acquisition program, interpret the data and complete an assessment.

The collaboration and coordination under this MOU has allowed DOD to identify areas of strategic importance to their military operations and to work with DOIIMMS in setting lease stipulations (i.e., window of operations on existing leases in the EGOM east of the Military Mission Lin) and other administrative requirements on leases in areas of which DOD and DOIIMMS have agreed to allow leasing and post lease activities. The Military Mission Line is an administrative line; one that was established through the ongoing collaborative efforts between DOD and MMS. These efforts have proven to be successful and responsive to the needs of both Agencies and the nation's national security and development of energy resources. This is not a one-time coordination effort; MMS and DOD are involved in on-going communication. This MOA is currently being updated to include the new renewable energy program activities.

Deborah, On January 21,2009, the MMS published in the Federal Register a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Atlantic G&G programmatic EIS. This EIS would analyze the potential for effects from the conduct of all types ofG&G activities in the U .S. Atlantic oes, mainly seismic surveys. The comment period closed on March 23, 2009, and the comments are currently being analyzed. In the NOI, the MMS acknowledged there is currently no existing funding for this EIS and welcomed participation from outside sources. A final decision has not been made to begin the EIS work. To date: o o

Six geophysical companies have submitted ten permit applications to acquire seismic data on the Atlantic OCS. The applications total over 270,000 line miles of 2-D data, covering all or part of the three Atlantic Planning Areas from Maine to Florida. An additional four companies are expressing interest. There is a concentration of overlapping surveys, primarily in the mid and south Atlantic areas. As stated in the NOI, MMS will need to prepare the Programmatic EIS to evaluate the environmental impacts of activities in this area prior to issuing permits.

This map is on our website and is attached here FYI.

The Dorgan amendment, as I understanding it eliminates GOM moratoria under GOMESA and establishes a 45 mile buffer along FL Gulf coast; going west along the Panhandle, stopping at the eastern border of the Destin Dome mapping area. This interpretation does open the Pensacola mapping area for leasing.

Secretary Salazar Names Liz Birnbaum Director of the Minerals Management Service
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar today appointed Liz Birnbaum, an attorney with two decades of Federal Government and private sector experience in energy and environmental policy, as Director of the Department's Minerals Management Service. The appointment does not require Senate confirmation. ""As a former Associate Solicitor here at Interior with extensive experience as counsel and staff director for congressional committees, Liz brings a number of strengths to this key position at Interior,"" Secretary Salazar said. ""Her in-depth knowledge of energy issues, natural resource policy and environmental law as well as her managerial expertise and work in coalition building will be especially important as we advance President Obama's new energy frontier and lay the foundation for a clean energy economy."" As Director of the Minerals Management Service, Birnbaum administers programs that ensure the effective management of renewable and traditional energy and mineral resources on the nation's Outer Continental Shelf, including the environmentally safe exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, and the collection and distribution of revenues for minerals developed on federal and American Indian lands. Since 2007, Birnbaum has been staff director of the Committee on House Administration, where she oversees strategy development, budget management and staff activities for the committee that manages legislative branch agencies. Before that she was Vice President for Government Affairs and General Counsel for American Rivers, where she directed advocacy programs for the nation's leading river conservation organization from 2001 to 2007. She coordinated staff work, built coalitions with other national and grassroots conservation organizations and represented the organization before congressional committees and executive branch agencies.

At Interior, Birnbaum was Associate Solicitor for Minerals Resources from 2000 to 2001, supervising and managing a staff of attorneys that provided legal advice, developed regulations and conducted litigation on minerals issues for the Minerals Management Service, Bureau of Land Management and Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation. Before that she was a special assistant to the Interior Solicitor, from 1999 to 2000, overseeing legal policy on a range of natural resource issues, including mining law, public land management and hydropower licensing. From 1991 to 1999 she was counsel to the House Committee on Natural Resources, where she handled legislative and oversight activities for the Department of the Interior, U.S. Forest Service and electric power marketing administrations. From 1987 to 1991 she was counsel for the Water Resources Program of the National Wildlife Federation. Birnbaum has been an officer and member of numerous boards and commissions, including the National Capital Section of the American Water Resources Association; Arlington County Environment and Energy Conservation Commission; and the Environment, Energy and Natural Resources Section of the District of Columbia Bar. Birnbaum received her Juris Doctor degree from Harvard University in 1984 and her A.B. degree, magna cum laude, from Brown University in 1979. She was Editor in Chief of the Harvard Environmental Law Review, Vol. 8. The Minerals Management Service manages the nation's offshore Renewable Energy Program as well as the development of natural gas, oil and other mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. The agency also collects, accounts for and disburses more than $13 billion per year in revenues from Federal offshore mineral leases and from onshore mineral leases on Federal and American Indian lands. The agency administers two major programs, Offshore Energy and Minerals Management and Minerals Revenue Management. The Offshore program, which manages the mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf, comprises three regions: Alaska, Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific. The Minerals Revenue Management program is headquartered in Washington, D.C., but operationally based in Denver, Colorado. ###

that encourage efficiency and conservation, as well as the production and use of renewable energy sources. With regard to the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) provisions (Division C, Title 1, 120 Stat. 3000), GOMESA: o Lifted the congressional moratorium on oil and gas leasing and development in a portion of the Central GOM and mandates lease sales in two areas of the GOM (the 181 Area and 181 South Area as defined by GOMESA) notwithstanding the omission of those two areas from any OCS leasing program under section 18 of the OCS Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1344); o Established a moratorium through June 30, 2022, in the vast majority ofthe Eastern Planning Area and a small portion of the Central Planning Area; o Provided for the establishment of a process to exchange existing leases in the new moratorium areas for bonus or royalty credits that may only be used in the GOM; and o Provided for the distribution of certain OCS revenues to the Gulf producing States of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and to certain CPSs within those States. This final rule sets forth how the Department of the Interior (DOl) will implement the GOMESA requirements related to the distribution of OCS revenues to the Gulf producing States and their CPSs. Summary For each of the fiscal years from 2007 through 2016, GOMESA directs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit 50 percent of qualified OCS revenuesbonuses, rents, and royalties-from OCS oil and gas leases in areas designated as the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area and the 181 South Area into a special account in the U.S. Treasury. The GOMESA directs the Secretary of the Interior, for each of these fiscal years, to disburse 25 percent of the revenues in the special account to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and the remaining 75 percent to the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively identified as the ""Gulf producing States"") and their eligible CPSs. The revenues are to be allocated among the Gulf producing States based on their inverse proportional distance from the leases in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area and the 181 South Area and in accordance with regulations established by the Secretary of the Interior. The GOMESA also provides that in determining the individual Gulf producing States' share of the qualified OCS revenues, no State, irrespective of the amount established by the application of the inverse proportional distance formula, shall receive less than 10 percent of the revenues to be disbursed. The GOMESA directs the Secretary of the Interior to disburse 20 percent of the funds allocated to each Gulf producing State, to political subdivisions within the State which are located in the State's coastal zone, and are within 200 nautical miles of the geographic center of any OCS leased tract. Revenues are allocated to the CPSs based on their population, miles of coastline, and their inverse proportional distance from designated leases in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area.

computed to full precision and only the final disbursement amount will be rounded. The following example shows the revenue sharing formula used to calculate each Gulf producing State's share of GOMESA qualified OCS revenues. (1) For each Gulf producing State, we will calculate and total, over all applicable leased tracts, the mathematical inverses of the distances between the points on the State's coastline that are closest to the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts and the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts. (2) For each Gulf producing State, we will divide the sum of each State's inverse distances, from all applicable leased tracts, by the sum ofthe inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts across all four Gulf producing States. We will multiply the result by the amount of qualified OCS revenues to be shared, as shown below. In the formulas, IAL , kA' IMS , and Irx represent the sum of the inverses of the closest distances between Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and all applicable leased tracts, respectively.

Adding the three States' shares to the Texas ' 10 percent share sums to $36 million. The MMS will distribute 20 percent of each Gulf producing State's allocable share to eligible coastal political subdivisions. Each State's CPS share is calculated by the following formula: (1) Twenty-five percent shall be allocated to each CPS in the proportion that the coastal population of the CPS bears to the coastal population of all CPSs in the producing State; (2) Twenty-five percent shall be allocated to each CPS in the proportion that the number of miles of coastline of the CPS bears to the number of miles of coastline of all CPSs in the producing State. For the State of Louisiana, proxy coastline lengths for CPSs without a coastline will be considered to be '13 the average length of the coastline of all political subdivisions within Louisiana having a coastline. (3) Fifty percent shall be allocated in amounts that are inversely proportional to the respective distances between the points in each CPS that are closest to the geographic center of each leased tract. The following is a continuation of the prior example, detailing the estimated allocations for the two State of Alabama eligible CPSs-Baldwin and Mobile counties. For this example, it is assumed that tl and h are both in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area. The revenue allocated to the Alabama CPSs is 20 percent ofthe $12,500,787 calculated above which is $2,500,157. Twenty-five percent of the allocation, equal to $625,039, is based on the CPS 's population proportion. The 2000 Census numbers are : Baldwin County-140,415; Mobile County-399,843, and the corresponding population proportions are 25.99 percent and 74.01 percent, respectively. Thus, $162,448 is allocated to Baldwin, and $462,591 is allocated to Mobile. A second 25 percent of the allocation is based on the CPS's proportion of coastline length. The coastline lengths in nautical miles for Alabama's CPSs are: Baldwin-28.249; Mobile-22.045, and the corresponding proportions of coastline length are 56.17 percent and 43.83 percent, respectively. Thus, $351,084 is allocated to Baldwin, and $273,955 is allocated to Mobile. Finally, 50 percent ofthe allocation, equal to $1,250,079, is based on the proportion of summed inverse distances between the CPSs and the applicable leased tracts. The distance measures and inverse distance calculations for the CPSs are conceptually identical to those employed above in assessing the State shares. Let us assume the following distances and resulting inverse distance calculations for the two CPSs:

Further, suppose that fiscal year qualified OCS revenues are $96 million , $12 million of which would go to the LWCF, and $36 million of which would be allocated to the Gulf producing States. Applying the formulas above, the $36 million would be allocated to the Gulf producing States as shown below. Alabama Share = (0.0343 + 0.0980) x $36 million = $12,600,000.00 Louisiana Share = (0.0236 + 0.0980) x $36 million = $8 ,669,387.76 Mississippi Share = (0.0310 + 0.0980) x $36 million = $11,387,755.10 Texas Share = (0.0091 + 0.0980) x $36 million = $3,342,857.14 However, because Texas' share is less than $3.6 million or 10 percent of the allocation of $36 million, we would allocate a 10 percent share to Texas and recalculate the other Gulf producing States' shares omitting Texas and its 10 percent share from the calculation as shown below. Alabama Share = (0.0343 + (0.0980 0.0091)) x $32.4 million = $12,500,787.40 Louisiana Share = (0.0236 + (0 .0980 0.0091)) x $32.4 million = $8,601,124.86 Mississippi Share = (0.0310 + (0 .0980 0.0091)) x $32.4 million = $11,298 ,087.74 Total = $32,400,000 Texas Share = 10% x $36 million = $3,600,000

According to the table above, the proportions of the summed inverse distances for each CPS are: Baldwin Alabama county

In this hypothetical example, the county of Baldwin would receive $1,160,198 (46.41 percent) and the county of Mobile $1,339,959 (53.59 percent) of the $2,500,157 Alabama CPS share.

The GOMESA requires that each Gulf producing State and CPS use all amounts received for one or more of the following purposes: o Projects and activities for the purposes of coastal protection, including conservation, coastal

restoration, hurricane protection, and infrastructure directly affected by coastal wetland losses. o Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources . o Implementation of a Federally approved marine, coastal, or

Federal Register/Vol. 73 , No. 247/Tuesday, December 23, 200B/Rules and Regulations
comprehensi ve conservation management plan. o Mitigation of the impact of OCS activities through the funding of onshore infrastructure projects. o Planning assistance and administrative costs not to exceed 3 percent of the amounts received. The GOMESA establishes a separate revenue sharing provision to be implemented for fiscal year 2017 and thereafter. This rule covers revenue sharing provisions for the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area and 181 South Area, which are the only revenues shared through 2016. While revenue sharing from these two areas will continue to be shared indefinitely according to GOMESA, the second phase of GOMESA revenue sharing adds qualified OCS revenue from GOM leases issued after December 20, 2006, in the 181 Call Area and 2002-2007 GOM Planning Areas subject to withdrawal or moratoria restrictions and revenue caps identified in the act. The second phase of GOMESA revenue sharing will be addressed in a subsequent rulemaking. Comments Leading to Rule Modifications The States of Alabama and Louisiana requested that MMS clarify the timing and nature of GOMESA revenue disbursements to the Gulf producing States and eligible CPSs so that recipients can effectively plan projects and be certain of the date they will receive funds . Further, both States requested that funds be disbursed as early in the fiscal year as possible. The MMS has revised ? 219.418 of the rule to affirm that MMS intends to disburse revenues on or before March 31st ofthe year following the fiscal year of qualified OCS revenues. The MMS requires several months to complete end-of-year audit procedures and validate the allocations of the inverse distance formulas. While issues could potentially arise making it difficult to meet the March 31st date for disbursement of all applicable revenues to all recipients, if MMS cannot meet this date, revenue recipients would be alerted. Revenues will be disbursed by electronic funds transfer (EFT) to each State and CPS. The EFT is a standard practice of the Federal Government, and EFT disbursement procedures are not included in the regulation. The MMS has contacted each State and CPS to obtain recipient electronic fund transfer and account information. The State of Louisiana requested the regulation identify a single bureau point of contact for GOMESA revenue sharing questions. The MMS has designated the Chief, Financial Management, Minerals Revenue Management, as the lead contact on GOMESA revenue sharing issues. Contact information is found in ? 219.410. The State of Louisiana commented that the exclusion in the proposed regulation of rental revenues or user fees credited to MMS appropriated funds through the annual Congressional appropriations process from revenue sharing is contrary to the requirements of GOMESA. The definition of qualified OCS revenues in the ? 219.411 definition has been modified in response to Louisiana's comment. As discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule, appropriations language has been included annually since 1993 which provides MMS rental revenues above the $3.00/acre rate in effect on August 5,1993, up to an annual cap, to fund current operations. The GOMESA revenue sharing formula created an unforeseen dual claim on rental revenues. To avoid any ambiguity, the regulation has been changed from the proposed rule to recognize that in the absence of a specific exclusion of qualified OCS revenues from leases in statute or appropriations language, GOMESA lease revenues are shared first with States/CPSs and the LWCF by the revenue sharing formula in this regulation and the remainder would be available for other uses as identified by statute or appropriations law. An exception would occur if Congress adopts explicit appropriations or statutory language which restricts or eliminates the sharing of certain GOMESA revenues from this revenue sharing program, or changes the definition of GOMESA qualified OCS revenues to recognize a different treatment of revenues. In those cases the circumscribed revenues would not be shared under the GOMESA revenue sharing program. The State of Louisiana also objected to the exclusion of user fees from qualified OCS revenues. Unlike bonuses, rentals, and royalties , user fees (also called cost recovery fees) are not revenue ""from leases."" User fees are payments made by operators or lessees for provisions of special services such as transfer of record title and review of exploration or development plans. They are collected by MMS based on the direct cost of providing a service to the lessees, and are not considered receipts directly emerging from a lease's revenues themselves. A civil penalty payment, which was excluded in the GOMESA, is similar to a user fee payment. A civil penalty is a payment for a violation of regulations and a user fee is payment for a service. While civil penalties and user fees may be paid for an action or

78625

authorization that happens on a lease, they are not revenues resulting from the lease itself. The revenues from a lease (bonuses, rentals, and royalties) reflect the value of the lessor's (Le., the Federal Government's) property interest in the leased minerals. Since GOMESA revenue sharing is intended to share revenues resulting from the oil and gas property interest, user fees are not from leases, and thus, excluded from qualified OCS revenues for GOMESA revenue sharing. The MMS has provided a separate line in the ? 219.411 definition to recognize that user fees are not from leases and not shared under the GOMESA revenue sharing formula . Comments were received from Alabama, Louisiana, and the State of Texas General Land Office related to authorized uses of the GOMESA revenue sharing funds. In summary, each Gulf producing State receiving GOMESA funds has different coastal conservation needs, and subsequently will utilize GOMESA funds to accomplish diverse goals via a variety of projects and activities. Therefore, Gulf producing States and CPSs have requested broad discretion to interpret the GOMESA legislation in a manner that accomplishes each State's coastal conservation and protection needs, such as hurricane protection measures and specific educational uses . In this regard, it is important to note that GOMESA does not provide the Secretary of the Interior a compliance responsibility or enforcement mechanism similar to the plan review and approval authority included in the OCSLA Coastal Impact Assistance Program (ClAP). Accordingly, while the recipients of the GOMESA revenue sharing funds are legally obligated under GOMES A to expend the funds received only on the authorized uses enumerated in the Act, the MMS's role in this program is to calculate shares and transfer the applicable funds to the States and CPSs in a manner similar to the approach it follows in disbursing revenue sharing funds to the States under the offshore 8(g) program or the onshore oil and gas revenue sharing program. That is , once the funds are transferred, MMS no longer has Federal oversight. However, since the GOMESA enumerates the authorized uses for shared revenues, GOMESA's authorized uses have been added to the ? 219.410 subpart introduction. The regulations do not include Interior compliance or enforcement activities since none were assigned by the GOMESA.

78626

Federal Register/Vol. 73, No. 247/Tuesday, December 23,.2008 /Rules and Regulations tracts in the 181 and 181 South Area only. In section 102, paragraph (10)(B), an eligible CPS is defined as one in which any part is ""not more than 200 miles from the geographic center of any leased tract,"" not just those in the 181 and 181 South Area. In addition, this is how the 2007-2010 Coastal Impact Assistance Program defined leased tract. If the GOMESA authors wanted to limit eligible CPSs only to those within 200 miles of an applicable leased tract, this was the place to do it; yet, they did not provide that constraint. Thus, since all Texas CPSs are within 200 miles of a leased tract in the GOM, all will share in the revenue sharing provisions of this rule. The States of Alabama and Louisiana requested that MMS specify in the regulations that a State can use GOMESA funds to match Federal grant programs that are consistent with GOMESA's authorized uses. As noted in Louisiana's comments, the GOMESA is silent on the use of GOMESA funds for cost sharing or matching requirements with other Federal grant programs and various other forms of Federal assistance. Thus, consistent with a Federal grant program's application of funds for GOMESA authorized uses, it appears that GOMESA funds may be used to meet a certain Federal program's recipient matching requirement depending on whether or not that specific Federal program's statutory language or guidelines specifically excludes Federal funds from being used by the recipient as matching funds. The State of Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, inquired about the timing of when MMS will publish the rule for GOMESA revenue sharing to be implemented for fiscal year 2017 and thereafter. The State of Louisiana commented that this rule should not be restricted to the 2007-2016 period, but should include the additional GOMESA revenue sharing provisions that will begin in 2017 from leases issued after December 20, 2006, in the 2002-2007 GOM planning areas. We intend to publish the rulemaking for the second phase of GOMESA revenue sharing within the next 2 years. This will provide time for MMS to incorporate any lessons learned during the first phase of GOMESA revenue sharing and to include similar revenue sharing provisions if authorized in future legislation, while avoiding the need to extend the publication date of this rule. In addition to the request that this rulemaking include the second phase of GOMESA revenue sharing, Louisiana asserted that GOMESA required rulemaking to ensue within 1 year of its passage and that MMS has not met this requirement. We note that this interpretation of GOMESA by Louisiana is incorrect. The requirement that rulemaking be promulgated not later than 1 year after the passage of the GOMESA only applies to Section 104 of the Act. The regulations required by GOMESA section 104(c)(4) only address the issuance of credits for the relinquishment of select leases offshore of Florida. Section 105 of the GOMESA addresses the revenue sharing provisions in this rule, and it includes no deadline for promulgation of rulemaking. The State of Louisiana raises several points related to the definition of qualified OCS revenues found in ? 219.411, including the exclusion of rental revenues allocated to MMS through the annual appropriations process, user fees, royalty-in-kind oil delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and not sold, and alternative energy/use revenues. The intent and requirement of GOMESA is that we promulgate regulations that describe in specific detail the distribution of GOMESA qualified OCS revenues. This rulemaking defines qualified OCS revenues to properly account for situations, revenue sources, and claims on OCS revenues not clearly identified in GOMESA. Our conclusion on the proper treatment of rental revenues and user fees is found in the preceding section which covers modifications made to the proposed rule. The State of Louisiana requested that this regulation provide revenue shares to the Gulf producing States based on royalties from GOMESA qualified leases taken by the Secretary in-kind, delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), and later drawn down. Louisiana also requested that the proposed rule be revised to require MMS to sell all royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil it receives from GOMESA leases, which will raise the State revenue shares, but will mean that none of that oil could be delivered to the SPR. The MMS policies related to RIK oil are designed to optimize benefits to the Nation as a whole. The GOMESA is clear that RIK oil not sold and, by implication, transferred or used for trades to stock the Department of Energy's SPR is excluded from qualified OCS revenue. Accordingly, MMS has no authority to selectively exclude oil from GOMESA leases or to compensate Louisiana with proceeds from a subsequent sale of oil from the SPR that originated as RIK oil following a draw down order from the President. The SPR is managed as a National strategic asset by the Department of

Comments Not Leading to Rule Modifications The State of Louisiana requested that States and their CPSs be allowed to designate a trustee to receive their annual GOMESA revenue allocations. Louisiana further states that assigning funds to a trustee would provide States and their CPSs a ""capability to maximize their ability to further the purposes of GOMESA by leveraging their payment streams into long-term financing instruments."" The regulation remains silent on the designation of a funds trustee. The GOMESA specifically enumerates the four Gulf producing States, CPSs, and the LWCF as the recipients of GOMESA revenue sharing funds. It is MMS's standard practice to disburse revenue sharing funds to the Government entity to which the revenues are shared. Therefore, MMS intends to distribute GOMESA revenues to the designated State or CPS account in the name of State or CPS and not directly to a trustee. A State or CPS is then free to adopt spending procedures involving trustees. A Texas General Land Office comment requested clarification on how GOMESA's revenue sharing 200-mile limit from the center of a leased tract will affect certain Texas coastal counties. Some Texas CPSs are beyond 200 miles from the center of an applicable leased tract in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area. There are several points in the GOMESA that contribute to the understanding of the revenue allocations to Texas CPSs from the revenue sharing provisions under this rule. First, no State shall receive less than 10 percent of the revenues. Because Texas is the farthest distance from the revenue sharing areas of any Gulf producing State, the inverse distance calculation will provide less revenue to Texas than the other Gulf producing States, so Texas is the State most likely to be affected by the minimum distribution requirement. Second, the CPSs receive 20 percent of the revenues allocated to the States, so the statute provides a share of Texas revenues to the CPSs. Third, and key to understanding the implications on Texas CPSs of the revenue sharing provisions under this rule, there is the difference between an applicable leased tract and any leased tract. The MMS defines both applicable leased tract and leased tract in the regulation. The term applicable leased tract appears twice in section 105 of the GOMESA at paragraphs (b)(l)(A) and (2)(A)(i), and this term clearly refers to

Federal Register/Vol. 73, No. 247/Tuesday, December 23, 2008/Rules and Regulations
Energy. The DOl has no authority over the SPR. Thus, the rule will continue to exclude RIK royalties for oil or gas taken in-kind and not sold. The State of Louisiana requests that ? 219.415 in the proposed rule be revised to not reduce the revenues shared with States and CPSs if bonus or royalty credits are used on GOMESA leases. Section 219.415 states that use of bonus or royalty credits on a GOMESA lease will reduce qualified OCS revenues available for distribution. Section 104(c) of GOMESA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue a bonus or royalty credit for use only in the GOM for the exchange of certain leases located offshore of the State of Florida. Thus, there is a possibility that some of the credits could be used on GOMESA revenue sharing leases. However, given the thousands of other leases to which the credits may be applied, and the incentives for credit holders to use them quickly, by far the bulk of the credits are likely to be used to pay bonus and royalty obligations on leases that are not subject to GOMESA revenue sharing provisions. Moreover, the regulations for bonus or royalty credits authorized under GOMESA are found in the final rule titled Bonus or Royalty Credits for Relinquishing Certain Leases Offshore, RIN 1010--AD44, published September 12,2008 (FR 7352917). This rule deals with this same issue. Unlike the case with revenue from 8(g) leases, GOMESA does not exclude these credits from being applied to bonus or royalty obligations for leases subject to GOMESA revenue sharing provisions. To the extent this occurs, the U.S. would receive less qualified OCS . revenues on GOMESA leases than if the bidders or lessees had paid in cash. It necessarily follows that any distribution of royalty or bonus payments to a State or CPS based on lower qualified revenues should result in a corresponding reduction from what it would have been had the entire payment been made in cash on the eligible leases. However, the MMS projects the effect of bonus or royalty credits from section 104(c) of GOMESA on revenue sharing to be very limited. Since GOMESA distribution requirements apply only to revenues derived from new leases issued in the portion ofthe 181 Area located in the Eastern Planning Area and to the 181 South Area, production, and hence royalty, from such leases likely will not occur anytime soon. Additionally, these credits must be claimed by October 2010 and there are thousands of other leases where the credits, amounting to $60.4 million,

could be promptly applied. We have not under Small Business Regulatory complied with Louisiana's request and Enforcement Fairness Act (5 U.S.C. have not changed the regulation because 804(2)) since it will not have an annual we see little chance that the credits will effect on the economy of $100 million affect State allocations and too much or more or meet the other major rule complexity is required to exclude such criteria. The commenter further requests a remote possibility. that MMS reconsider the expected The State of Louisiana proposes that revenues to be shared under this revenues derived from alternative uses program considering current price oIthe OCS in the 181 Area in the projections and the designation of this Eastern Planning Area and 181 South rule as not a major rule.

interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency. No other agency is affected by the disbursements mandated by GOMESA. (3) This rule will not alter the budgetary effects of entitlements. grants. user fees. or loan programs or the rights or obligations of their recipients. (4) This rule does not raise novel legal or policy issues . This rule will merely provide formulas and methods to implement an Act of Congress. Previously. section 8(g) of the OCS Lands Act and section 384 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 have provided for the distribution of a portion of OCS revenues to coastal States and local governments with distributions under the latter statute using essentially the same formulas and methods in this rule. a. Will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. The provisions of this rule specify how qualified OCS revenues will be allocated to States and CPSs. The rule will have no effect on the amount of royalties. rents, or bonuses owed by lessees. operators. or payers regardless of size and. consequently. will not have a significant adverse economic effect on offshore lessees and operators. including those classified as small businesses. The Gulf producing States and CPS recipients of the revenues will likely fund contracts that will benefit the local economies. small entities, and the environment. These effects are projected to be less than $100 million annually. b. Will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers. individual industries. Federal. State, local government agencies. or geographic regions. c. Will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment. investment, productivity. innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. The effects. if any. of distributing revenues to the States and CPSs are projected to be beneficial.

Finally, like other Federal energy revenue sharing programs with the States (e .g., Mineral Leasing Act, Section 8(g) of the OCS Lands Act), GOMESA revenue sharing is based on the revenue received each year, including any compliance collections reflecting prior year adjustments. Compliance activities are conducted to ensure the Federal Government receives all the money it is entitled. Moreover, all GOMESA collections of qualified OCS revenues. including compliance collections, will be shared with States, CPSs. and the LWCF. Other Changes to the Rule The definition for applicable leased tract has been revised. The proposed rule included OCS Lands Act section 6 leases in the definition of an applicable oil and gas leased tract for GOMESA revenue sharing. Since section 6 of the OCS Lands Act applies to leases issued by States prior to the passage of the OCS Lands Act. and GOMESA revenue sharing provisions apply to applicable leased tracts issued after the passage of GOMESA. this previous inclusion was incorrect.

Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S .C. 601 et seq.). The provisions of this rule specify how qualified OCS revenues will be allocated to certain States and eligible Procedural Matters CPSs. The rule will have no effect on the amount of royalties , rents, or Regulatory Planning and Review bonuses owed by lessees, operators. or (Executive Order (E. 0.) 12866) payers regardless of size and.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act This rule will not impose an unfunded mandate on State, local. or tribal governments or the private sector of more than $100 million per year. The final rule will not have a significant or unique effect on State. local. or tribal governments or the private sector. A statement containing the information required by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) is not required because the rule is not a mandate. It merely provides the formulas and methods to implement an allocation of revenue to certain States and eligible CPSs. as directed by Congress. Further. the statute allows 3 percent of funds allocated to Gulf producing States and CPSs to be used for planning and administrative activities. Takings Implication Assessment (E.o.

?219.413 How will the coastal political subdivisions of Gulf producing States share in the qualified DeS revenues?

Of the revenues allocated to a Gulf producing State, 20 percent will be distributed to the coastal political subdivisions within that State.
?219.414 How will MMS determine each Gulf producing State's share of the qualified DeS revenues?

(a) The MMS will determine the geographic centers of each applicable leased tract and, using the great circle distance method, will determine the closest distance from the geographic centers of each applicable leased tract to each Gulf producing State's coastline. (b) Based on these distances, we will calculate the qualified OCS revenues to be disbursed to each Gulf producing State using the following procedure: (1) For each Gulf producing State, we will calculate and total, over all applicable leased tracts, the mathematical inverses of the distances between the points on the State's coastline that are closest to the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts and the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts. For applicable leased tracts intersected by the planning area administrative boundary line, the geographic center used for the inverse distance determination will be the geographic center of the entire lease as if it were not intersected. (2) For each Gulf producing State, we will divide the sum of each State's inverse distances , from all applicable leased tracts, by the sum of the inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts across all four Gulf producing States. We will multiply the result by the amount of qualified OCS revenues to be shared as shown below. In the formulas , I AL , IIA, IMs , and hx represent the sum of the inverses of the closest distances between Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and all applicable leased tracts, respectively.

Federal Register/Vol. 73, No. 247/Tuesday, December 23, 200B/Rules and Regulations Alabama Share = (IAL -7 (I AL + lLA + I Ms + hx)) x Qualified OCS Revenues Louisiana Share = (I LA -7 (I AL + lLA + IMs + hx)) x Qualified OCS Revenues Mississippi Share = (IMS -7 (IAL + lLA + I Ms + hx)) x Qualified OCS Revenues Texas Share = (I TX -7 (IAL + lLA + IMs + hx)) x Qualified OCS Revenues (3) If in any fiscal year, this calculation results in less than a 10 percent allocation of the qualified OCS revenues to any Gulf producing State, we will recalculate the distribution. We will allocate 10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues to the State and recalculate the other States' shares of the remaining qualified OCS revenues omitting the State receiving the 10 percent minimum share and its 10 percent share from the calculation.

If bonus and royalty credits issued under Section 104(c) of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act are used to pay bonuses or royalties on leases in the 181 Area located in the Eastern Planning Area and the 181 South Area, then there will be a corresponding reduction in qualified OCS revenues available for distribution.
?219.416 How will the qualified OCS revenues be allocated to coastal political subdivisions within the Gulf producing States?

The MMS will disburse funds to the coastal political subdivisions in accordance with the following criteria: (a) Twenty-five percent of the qualified OCS revenues will be allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in the proportion that each coastal political subdivision's population bears to the population of all coastal political subdivisions in the producing State; (b) Twenty-five percent of the qualified OCS revenues will be allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in the proportion that each coastal political subdivision's miles of coastline bears to the number of miles of coastline of all coastal political subdivisions in the producing State. Except that, for the State of Louisiana, proxy coastline lengths for coastal political subdivisions without a coastline will be considered to be V3 the average length of the coastline of all political subdivisions within Louisiana having a coastline. (c) Fifty percent of the revenues will be allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in amounts that are inversely proportional to the respective distances between the

If, during any fiscal year, there are no applicable leased tracts in the 181 Area in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, MMS will disburse funds to the coastal political subdivisions in accordance with the following criteria: (a) Fifty percent of the revenues will be allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in the proportion that each coastal political subdivision's population bears to the population of all coastal political subdivisions in the State; and (b) Fifty percent of the revenues will be allocated to a Gulf producing State's coastal political subdivisions in the proportion that each coastal political subdivision's miles of coastline bears to the number of miles of coastline of all coastal political subdivisions in the State. Except that, for the State of Louisiana, proxy coastline lengths for coastal political subdivisions without a coastline will be considered to be % the average length of the coastline of all political subdivisions within Louisiana having a coastline.

Linda, I raised your questions. The final rule for the distribution and allocation of GOEMSA funds presents the statute's approved uses of the GOMESA funds by the States and CPSs. A copy of the Federal Register publication of the final rule is attached and the text is highlighted on page 3. In addition, the distribution of the funds is done through electronic funds transfer directly to the States' and CPS's using the banking information provided by them. A letter is sent notifying each State and CPS recipient of the amount to be transferred and the date by which the transfer will be completed . This notification letter refers the recipient to the GOMESA law and to the MMS regulations, 30 CFR 219.410-415 (discussed above).

Hi - Thanks for this - very helpful. I understand the difference between ClAP and GOMESA in terms of explicit requirements/responsibilities for MMS. But I thought at least some sort of transmittal document that accompanies the

GOMESA funds would condition their expenditure in the same way that the statute does , or at least refer to the statutory cite that contains the limitations. Is there nothing like that? Did your solicitor opine about what if any recourse there might be for the federal government if a state flagrantly ignored statutory requirements and used these funds for something else? DOJ would act under some sort of general fraud statute? Or was that not addressed when the statutory requirements were reviewed by the solicitor? thx Thanks again .

From: Herdt, Lyn Sent: Wednesday, July 22,20092:54 PM To: Lance, Linda (Energy); Haenny, Lesley Subject: RE: quick question
Linda, when Congress established the revenue sharing provisions of GOMESA, there was no oversight created for the Secretary. The Act directed the Secretary to calculate the allocations to the states and their coastal political subdivisions per the designated formula. While the Act sets out authorized uses, it does not authorize any federal management or oversight beyond disbursement of the qualified revenues in the FY following the FY in which the revenues were received. This is different from the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (ClAP) , for which Congress created a grant program under the Energy Policy Act. Under ClAP, the Secretary has a role from cradle to grave, so to speak . The states must work with their coastal political subdivisions to develop a plan for the use of the ClAP funds and the Secretary must review the state's submitted plan to ensure all projects meet the approved uses set out in statute. Once a state's plan is approved, applications are submitted on a project by project basis and the funds are made available. The Secretary is required to monitor all projects and to ensure proper use of the funds , and our oversight responsibilities remain until each project is completed and all funds have been expended . This oversight responsibility will extend far beyond the 4-years the ClAP funds are made available to the states (Fiscal Years 2007-2010). Two rulemakings were done for GOEMSA, one for the phase I of revenue sharing (allocation under the formula) and the second for the exchange of EGOM leases. The following link is to our GOMESA webpage and there are links to these two rules . http://www.mms.gov/offshore/GOMESARevenueSharing.htm I have received a few staff calls concerning this issue and most have thought MMS was to give direction to or monitor State use of the GOMESA funds. However, we did not interpret the legislation as giving this directive or authority to the Secretary and when enacted, our Solicitor'S Office did not read the statute to require oversight or to give the Secretary the authority to do so.

Hi - wondering if mms has any written guidelines/regs/etc. that go to the GOMESA states re how they can spend their revenue sharing $$. Haven't come across anything, and understand that mms does not track the $$ once they are distributed to the states? But was/is there something that goes either before the $$ are forwarded or with the $$ to inform the states about the statutory limitations on the use of these $$? If not, how is info provided to them? Do they have mms contacts that work with them on a regular basis?

I know there is a process/plan required for coastal impact assistance and that the GOMESA statute does not impose the same planning requirements . But thought there must be some method of at least informing the states of their responsibilities? Thanks as always for your good info. linda

Subject: 106 site visit

Good Morning Chris, This EMAIL is in response to our phone discussion yesterday, I am available for site visits all of the first week of August. I would also like to express my disappointment with MMS for their failure to meet with the tribes on the dates that were set at the 106 consultation meeting on 6/16. We all had the chance to check our calendars, a month in advance then weeks before MMS cancels and the process stops again. I would also like to advise MMS that it is an insult to refuse an invitation from a tribe to participate in a related cultural event and we are the ones being called uncooperative. Our tribes have very limited resources and unlike MMS very limited staff, when we set a meeting date we commit all of our resources this affects all of our other 106 consultations. People from your culture do not understand the importance of securing and protecting our sacred sites on two occasions we were asked to share these sites with strangers this will always be unacceptable, we don't share all of this information with our own tribal members but, I extend this to you, Melanie Stright or Rodney Cluck in the spirit of cooperation but, I still have concerns that this is only a tactic of the MMS to make it look like the tribes are being uncooperative.

Respectfully Yours,

AUG 19 2009

The Honorable Jo Bonner, Jr. House of Representatives Washington, D:C. 20515 Dear Representative Bonner: Thank you for your letter dated April 13,2009, to Christopher Mansour, Director of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, requesting clarification on bond payments for qualified projects under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA or Act). As Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), I have been asked to respond. As you know, the Act provides revenue sharing funds to the Gulf of Mexico producing states and Coastal Political Subdivisions (CPS), which include the State of Alabama and its counties of Mobile and Baldwin. Generally, the funds are to be used for coastal protection and mitigation of damages and impacts, as specifically mentioned in the Act. GOMESA did not provide the Secretary of the Interior with a compliance responsibility or enforcement mechanisms. Therefore, the MMS 's role in the program is to calculate shares and transfer the applicable funds to the States . and CPSs. Once the funds are transferred, MMS no longer has Federal oversight. The final regulations for Phase-I of GOMES A revenue sharing were published on December 23, 2008 (see 30 C.F.R. Part 219). These regulations provide the formula and methodology for allocation of qualified revenues, but do not include discussion of compliance or enforcement, as the Department does not appear to have those responsibilities under the Act. Accordingly, we do not believe we are in a position to provide guidance on the issue of whether GOMESA funds can be used to service debt relief on an approved project. However, in the preamble of the final regulations (73 FR 78622, 78626, December 23,2008), the MMS responded to a question from the State of Louisiana regarding the designation of a trustee for the receipt of GOMESA payments for the purpose of leveraging those payments into long-tem1 financing instruments: ... The GOMESA specifically enumerates the four Gulfproducing States, CPSs, and the LWCF as the recipients of GOMESA revenue sharing funds; It is MMS' s standard practice to disburse revenue sharing funds to the Government entity to which the revenues are shared. Therefore, MMS intends to distribute GOMESA revenues to the designated State or CPS account in the name of [the] State or CPS and not directly to a trustee. A State or CPS is then free to adopt spending procedures involving trustees.

TAKa:

Stratton, We issue permits for companies and/or geophysical contractors to acquire the data. There are no commissions issued. However, all surveys permits in the EGOM were issued to geophysical contractors to acquire multi-client surveys. These are also called speculative (or spec) surveys . These contractors own and control the data under the terms and conditions of the MMS permit and sell licenses to companies for use of all or parts of the data after acquisition and initial-to-final processing . The contractors will get some precommitment funding from oil companies in exchange for temporal and/or pricing considerations, but the data is owned and primarily funded by the contractors themselves . The geophysical companies listed are the owners of the seismic data. Our offshore office has highlighted these companies in red on the attached document.

Hi Stratton, August 3rd will work and I will narrow down the time hopefully by COB today. So I can get the appropriate folks out there to meet with you, can you tell me which topics you'd like discussed, for example, strictly Gulf of Mexico issues, the OCS as a whole, Florida issues, alternative energy, etc.? We have folks here who have some very specific knowledge about different issues and depending on what issues you want to discuss, I'd like them to attend the meeting, since they would be the most helpful.

Mrs. Chew, I'm writing to obtain clarification on the Congressman's question in the April 13, 2009 letter related to a State or Coastal Political Subdivision (CPS) using GOMESA funds to ""be used for debt relief of that particular [authorized] project."" We received a question from the State of Louisiana that was slightly different during the publication of the Proposed Rule (linked and excerpted below). The State of Louisiana requested that MMS disburse funds directly to the bondholder if requested by the State or CPS for an encumbered project. This is not a standard practice and MMS answered that we intend to disburse GOMESA
4

funds to the State or CPS however a State or CPS is then free to adopt spending procedures involving trustees. Final GOMESA Revenue Sharing Regulations: Page 78626: The State of Louisiana requested that States and their CPSs be allowed to designate a trustee to receive their annual GOMESA revenue allocations. Louisiana further states that assigning funds to a trustee would provide States and their CPSs a ""capability to maximize their ability to further the purposes of GOMESA by leveraging their payment streams into long-term financing instruments."" The regulation remains silent on the designation of a funds trustee. The GOMESA specifically enumerates the four Gulf producing States, CPSs, and the LWCF as the recipients of GOMESA revenue sharing funds. It is MMS's standard practice to disburse revenue sharing funds to the Government entity to which the revenues are shared . Therefore, MMS intends to distribute GOMESA revenues to the designated State or CPS account in the name of State or CPS and not directly to a trustee. A State or CPS is then free to adopt spending procedures involving trustees . I assume your constituents are asking if the State/CPS can use GOMESA revenue sharing funds to pay principal and interest to on a bond that was issued specifically for - or the proportional payment amount of the bond represents an authorized project's proportional share of the bond; and any bond payments would be made from the State or CPS receiving GOMESA funds? Thank you for any clarification you can provide. Sincerely, Marty Heinze MMS/OEMM/Economics Division 703-787-1010

Subject: RE: GOMESA Funding Use for Bond Payments on Authorized Projects
Mrs. Chew, We apologize for the delay responding to the Congressman's request. While we hoped to provide you a definitive date for our response to the Congressman's letter, we find ourselves still working on the broader policy issues surrounding our compliance and regulatory responsibilities under the GOMESA. A congressman's letter receives careful consideration and this letter has raised the question of whether the appropriate role of Interior extends beyond the distribution of shared revenues . In particular, we are faced with the question of what is the nature of guidance that can be provided by the Interior Department when the Act does not include an Interior Department compliance responsibility. We have not yet received final advice from the Solicitor on Interior's legal standing if we offer GOMESA revenue sharing guidance beyond the distribution of revenues . However, as of today we have been promised that a response will be forthcoming by the Interior Solicitor by Tuesday, June 23rd. After receipt of the Solicitor's advice and edits to our draft response, our letter will enter the surnaming process and be reviewed by higher-level officials of the Department. Accordingly, it will likely take two to three weeks before we can send a final response. We will let you know if we have any further problems meeting this timeline. Sincerely, Marty Heinze

RE: Geothermal Royalty Payments AnN: Mr. John Hovanec, Manager, Solid Minerals and Geothermal Dear Mr_ Hovanec, The County of Imperial receives from you royalty payments under six MMS leases for geothermal power production on federal land located within the county. Our county has been receiving payments under these leases for many years through a separate provision of California state law, and has more recently, after the federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, started to collect the additional amounts directly from MMS. In reviewing the ""County Explanation of Payment"" forms sent from you each month, we have noticed a wide va riat'ion in the amounts of royalty payments. The attached table illustrates the fluctuations which have occurred just over the last twelve months. We request that the audit cover the past 24 months, going back to the beginning of 2007. In past years, the revenues received by our county from these leases have amounted to well over $1 million dollars annually. Yet this last year, while energy prices have increased, our revenues have decreased dramatically. We hereby request an explanation and/or audit of these royalty calculations which will provide answers to the following questions: 1. 2. How are the royalty payments l,lnder these leases calculated? What specific factors cause the variations in royalty payments? Have there been unusual expenses in recent years affecting those payments? If so, what might the county expect to receive in royalty payments under normal conditions?

3. 4.

We understand that these questions may be difficult to answer with certainty, but it is imperative that we be able to more accurately project what revenues we might reasonably expect to receive from this source. If you require additional clarification or information to process this request, please contact me as soon as possible, and thank you for your consideration.

Nancy Wisch emailed Andy Home saying she was on vacation and then the office was closed due to weather and would get back with him. Nancy Wisch emailed Andy Home saying that MMS would conduct an audit and that the audit wouldn't happen until fiscal year 2010. Andy Home emailed Nancy Wisch asking ifthere is anyone from MMS who could look over their situation and give them some explanation of why the royalty payments made by Ormat have fluctuated so widely. MMS asks the State of California's Controllers Office to modify their FYlO workplan to include an audit of the leases that the Imperial County identified in their January 13, 2009 letter to John Hovanec.

Mr. Prael explained that our internal analysis had found that high royalties were reported and paid in the summer months when it takes less electricity to heat the water, and then some of the adjustments made in subsequent months were made for those high royalty paid months. These adjustments resulted in the lower royalty months to go even lower, or negative. Mr. Prael believes that Mr. Horne understood Mr. Prael asked Mr. Horne to send us his information on the revenues the county received in the past. MMS is not seeing any royalties as high as the information he is showing. We will do more research as to the source of these funds once we receive the data from Mr. Horne. For your information, prior to enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct), MMS disbursed shared geothermal revenues directly to the State and then the State disbursed to the counties. EPAct directed MMS to disburse shared geothermal revenues owed the county directly to the county. MMS may need to figure out how the State made pre-EPAct payments to the county and if anything changed with enactment of EPAct. If you have any further questions, please let us know. We will continue to share information with you as MMS works through this issue with Mr. Horne.

outcome is? I suspect the County may request further assistance. Thank you. From: Herdt, Lyn Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2009 12:41 PM To: Sanchez, Caridad (Boxer) Cc: Gonzales-Evans, Anita Subject: RE: Inquiry: Geothermal Royalty Payments Caridad, Attached for you information is a chronology of contacts and communication between MMS Minerals Revenue Management Program staff and Imperial County, CA officials. To summarize, MMS has a Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (FOGRMA) section 205 audit agreement with the California State Controllers Office to audit Federal leases within the State of California. In response to Mr. Horne's inquiry, MMS requested the State of California Controllers Office to modify their Fiscal Year 2010 audit work plan to include an audit of the leases that the County identified in their January 13, 2009 letter. California revised their FY 2010 work plan to include audits of the leases and assure MMS that this audit will be their first priority. The Controllers Office informed MMS that they would be contacting Mr. Horne. In addition, MMS conducted additional analysiS to try to determine what's gOing on with this company's royalty payments . Today, MMS's Minerals Revenue Management Program staff who have been working on the analysis will call the county and the State of California to discuss what they are finding from their analysis and from their conversations with the company. I do hope this information is helpful to you. If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to contact me or someone in my office.

Ms. Herdt, I am writing on behalf of the County of Imperial in California who are requesting clarification on the changes in their ,geothermal royalty payments. Can you assist in a response to the County. I have attached the latest communication between the County and the MMS. I also understand the State of California has a role and has requested clarification but has not yet received a response. I appreciate your assistance in advance.

Lesley, I am looking for ESRI shapefiles for the following : Lease 181 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act Moratorium Active Gulf of Mexico Leases Proposed lease sales 2010-2015 Proposed lease sales 2007-2012 And if MMS has these already generated, they would be greatly appreciated: 1998 Presidential Moratorium prior to cancelation Congressional Moratorium prior to expiration I have listed the shapefiles in order of priority. Some of these are available in other formats on your website, but the free tools I am using can't make use of them. If your GIS people can point me to a free conversion utility, that would be sufficient for some of these. Thank you for your assistance, David Greisen

D.C. 20515 Dear Representative Dreier: Thank you for your letter dated September 1, 2009, regarding your constituents' concerns over British Petroleum's (BP) semisubmersible oil and gas platform Atlantis. As the Federal agency charged with providing for the safe and environmentally-responsible development of the Nation's energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf, we take very seriously any credible information or concerns brought forward regarding the conduct of companies operating in Federal waters. In order to maintain the integrity of the investigation process, and based on guidance from the Department of Justice, we do not publicly discuss whether investigations are ongoing or pending. I can share with you that in July 2009, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) received a copy of a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Interior from a special interest group requesting an investigation into BP's Atlantis platform, which is operating in the Gulf of Mexico. I appreciate your interest in the work of MMS and assure you that we will continue to strive to ensure that offshore development is done safely and in an environmentally-responsible manner. If you have any questions, you may contact me or Ms. Lyn Herdt, MMS Office of Congressional Affairs, at (202) 208-3502. Sincerely,

!Production and royalty values have been curtailed for each lease at a maximum equal to the lease's DWRRA royalty suspension volume. 2Low and High Case prodUction estimates are based on MMS ungro .....n and grown lease-level estimates of reserves and resources, respectively. MMS growth conventions have a greater elIect on resources of higher certainty (proved reserves) and have less or no elIect on unproved reserves and undiscovered resources resulting in a narrowing of the range of estimates prescribed by thc low and the high cases. Royalty values vary between low and high cases for identical estimated resource levels depending on the timing of the corresponding estimated production profile. High case estimates are comprised of production estimates from leases that are typically estil1lllted to produce at higher rales than resources in the low case by virtue combinations of factors sueh as additional installed capacity, number of producing wells, and well productivity. Such elIects can result in high case production occuring sooner, and at lower prices, with less royalty value. lFuture prices are OMB,Revised ""Economic Assumptions for 2010 Budget"", Average Refiner'S Acquisition Cost for oil and Wellhead Price for natural gas (both are nominal price vectors and are adjusted to GOM market). Average Oill'rice for all future estimated oil production = $70.96 per bbl, average gas price == $7.40 per mcf. All future prices are estimated to exceed the DWRRA price thresholds. ""Transportation allowances 0($3.50 per bbl of oil and SO.30 per mef of gas were asswned. SBP, ConocoPhillips, Marathon, Shell, and Walter, along with their affiliates have signed agreements with MMS to accept the price thresholds applicable to the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases. Should the court's current decision in favor of Kerr McGee stand following the appeal process, these companies may exercise their option to terminate these agreements

lLow and High Case production estimates are based on MMS ungrown and grown lease-level estimates of reserves and resources, respectively.

The Honorable Dianne Feinstein Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations United States Senate \Vashington, D.C. 20510 Dear Chairman Feinstein:

INAMERICA

This letter updates information provided to you in a February 4, 2008, letter regarding oil and gas royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA) responding to your letter of April 18,2007, to former Secretary Kempthome. The information below relates to the three items you requested . 1. The current status of negotiations between the Department and the 45 companies holding 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds; a list which shows the companies that have agreed to renegotiate their leases; and the percent of the overall revenue loss that the Department attributes to each company. Currently, there are 43 companies that have record title or operating rights interest in the 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds. While we have had at least preliminary discussions with all companies that have held or currently hold significant interests, most companies appear to be waiting to see the outcome of the Kerr-McGee litigation. This Administration will continue to work with Congress to reach an appropriate resolution of this issue. The Department reached agreements with six companies (Enclosure 1), and they have been paying royalties consistent with the terms of the agreements. Enclosure 2 provides an update on the amount and percentage, attributed to each company, of royalties that would have been paid through December 31, 2008, if price thresholds had applied to these leases. Please note that there are some differences between Enclosures 1 and 2 because the 43 companies listed in Enclosure 1 are current lessees of record title in the 1998 and 1999 leases, whereas, the companies listed in Enclosure 2 are companies with operating rights ovmership in those 1998 and 1999 leases that have been or are currently in a producing status. Under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996, companies that are designated operators are primarily liable for royalty payments once leases are in producing status. 2. The current status of the Kerr-McGee legal challenge to the Department's authority to place price thresholds on any deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000; the anticipated resolution date for the case; and the Department's view on congressional legislation reaffinning the Department's authority to place price thresholds. On January 12, 2009, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion upholding the District Court and ruling in favor of Kerr-McGee. The Department of Justice is considering the Department's

2 recommendation that a motion be filed requesting the Fifth Circuit reconsider this ruling en

banco
3. The current status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been foregone on the 1998 and 1999 D WRRA leases, and estimates of future foregone royalties from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases and future royalties that may be at risk from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until these issues are resolved; and the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until the Kerr-McGee suit is resolved. As requested, Enclosure 3 provides an update on the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been forgone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases as of December 31, 2008. Enclosure 4 outlines the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases. The annual amount of royalties increased from $1.1 billion in our February 4,2008, letter to $1.5 billion to date. We will update these figures annually. Enclosure Sa provides a range of estimates, as of January 1, 2009, for future royalties from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases that may be at risk due to the KerrMcGee litigation and Enclosure 5b provides estimates of future production and royalty value from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases. The estimates range from $18 billion to $19.0 billion and $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion in current year dollars, respectively. We will continue to send you updates as new information becomes available. A copy of this letter is being sent to all Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Members. Should you or your staff have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by phone at (202) 208-6734.

I was shocked to learn about the deplorable safety conditions of the Atlantis, the deepest moored semi-submersible oil and gas platform in the world. Located in ""hurricane alley"" off the coast of New Orleans at a water depth of more than 7,000 feet, the Atlantis weighs 58,700 metric tons and has a production capacity of 8.4 million gallons of oil and 180 million cubic feet of gas a day. The project came online during the Bush Administration's tenure and began operating in October 2007. According to their own internal documents, BP characterizes the situation as having the potential for ""catastrophic operator errors."" The Atlantis poses a serious, immediate and potentially irreparable threat to the Gulf of Mexico's marine environment, oil workers and communities. Yet despite this fact, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Services (MMS) has not been responsive to concerns about the Atlantis. I am calling for the following actions in order to prevent a catastrophic oil accident in the Gulf of Mexico: -- Congress should launch an immediate investigation regarding the regulation of the Atlantis -- MSS should immediately suspend production at the Atlantis -- Congress should launch oversight hearings on MMS regarding the regulation of the Atlantis

Monica, My apologies for not remembering this while we were on the phone. Due to the nature of this request, I have included MMS' statement on inquiries into the Atlantis Platform. The Minerals Management Service received a copy of a letter from a special interest group to the Department of the Interior requesting an investigation into British Petroleum's Atlantis platform, which is operating in the Gulf of Mexico. MMS is currently reviewing the contents of the letter. As a matter of policy, however, we do not publicly discuss whether investigations are ongoing or pending in order to maintain the integrity of the investigation process. I realize this probably isn't very helpful at the moment, but this is all we are allowed to say for now. -Brad

Thank you for getting back to me. I am really just looking for information about the claims being made by this group. If there was a serious problem with Atlantis, I assume that there would be some mention of it somewhere in the press, but the only information available on the web is from the group (Food and Water Watch) that is making the accusation, which seems a little fishy. Without getting into specifics about whether or not MMS is conducting an investigation, can you provide me with information on whether there are any permit or documentation problems with Atlantis? As you probably know, the group claims that engineering certifications for the project are lacking. Dan Jourdan Rep. Levin's Legislative Director

Thanks for taking a look. Here is the text a form letter that was recently received by Rep. Moran :

Date Received : 7/17/2009 10:50:20 AM Subject: Prevent a Catastrophic Oil and Gas Accident That Could Devastate the Gulf for Decades! Message sent from: 8.15.20.112 Message: I was shocked to learn about the deplorable safety conditions of the Atlantis, the deepest moored semi-submersible oil and gas platform in the world. Located in ""hurricane alley"" off the coast of New Orleans at a water depth of more than 7,000 feet, the Atlantis weighs 58,700 metric tons and has a production capacity of 8.4 million gallons of oil and 180 million cubic feet of gas a day. The project came online during the Bush Administration's tenure and began operating in October 2007 . According to their own internal documents, BP characterizes the situation as having the potential for ""catastrophic operator errors."" The Atlantis poses a serious, immediate and potentially irreparable threat to the Gulf of Mexico's marine environment, oil workers and communities. Yet despite this fact, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Services (MMS) has not been responsive to concerns about the Atlantis. I am calling for the following actions in order to prevent a catastrophic oil accident in the Gulf of Mexico: -- Congress should launch an immediate investigation regarding the regulation of the Atlantis -- MSS should immediately suspend production at the Atlantis -- Congress should launch oversight hearings on MMS regarding the regulation of the Atlantis

From: Haenny, Lesley Sent: Tuesday, November 10, 2009 11: 11 AM To: 'White, Chloe' Cc: Herdt, Lyn; Gonzales-Evans, Anita Subject: RE: Atlantis platform

Dear Chloe,

1. Does BP have a complete and accurate set of ""as built"" drawings (including P&IDs) for the BP Atlantis project (including the Subsea sector) as it presently exists? If so, have the complete set of documents been verified by an qualified expert? If so, by whom?

MMS regulations do not require ""a complete and accurate set of 'as built' drawings."" The only regulations that require asbuilt drawings are the following : o 30 C.F.R. ? 250.903(a)(1), titled ""What records must I keep,"" requires that ""as-built"" documents be maintained at a location provided in the certification required by ? 250.9050).

o MMS confirmed that BP maintains documents it identifies as ""as built"" for the Atlantis . o 30 C .F.R. ? 250.9050) states that the approval for installation, modification, or repair of a platform requires a certification that certified design and as-built plans and specifications are on file at a given location.

o MMS confirmed that BP maintains documents it identifies as ""as built"" for the Atlantis. o 30 C.F.R. ? 250 .1008(b) requires a registered engineer or land surveyor certify pipeline right-of-way ""as-built"" location plats.

o This section requires a report after completion of pipeline construction that includes ""an 'as-built' location plat"" showing the location of a pipeline. o MMS confirmed the existence of as-built location plats for pipeline segments associated with the Atlantis . No regulation requires verification of these documents by a qualified expert.
2. Do Federal regulations which are subject to MMS enforcement require BP to maintain ""as built"" drawings for the project available for inspection by MMS?

See response to number 1.

3. Did MMS approve the production safety system for BP Atlantis pursuant to 30 CFR 250.800?

Yes, pursuant to 30 CFR 250.802(e).

Jessica, thank you or getting back to us; If you and Nicholas would like to schedule a meeting after the Recess, please let us know.

Oh, MMS would love to welcome you to the sale!! Sarah Bittleman is also interested in attending and she would be a good tour buddy for you at the sale. Liz Birnbaum, our new director, is hoping to attend part of sale. Our GOM staff will be happy to show you around at the sale; taking you into the ""backroom"" so you can see how the bids are handled, opened, recorded, etc., and answer any questions. The Western GOM Sale 210 is scheduled for Wed, August 19, 2009 at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in the Grand Ballroom, located at 300 Bourbon Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130. Reading of the bids will begin at 9:00 AM. I will get more details on the logistics for you; where you should be, when; who will meet you; what you'll see, etc. You should plan on getting to New Orleans the day before, Tuesday, August 18. The GOM Region anticipates that this will be a relatively small sale, and the opening of the bids should be completed within 3 or 4 hours; which means you'd be able to catch a flight out of New Orleans early afternoon.

Thanks Lyn - I'll keep in touch with the personal office on this, and Virginia is very responsive . On another note, someone mentioned to me that it might be possible for me to attend the 8/19 lease sale without being in the way. I'd be very interested in learning about how this works - never have attended a lease sale. Would that be a problem for you all? Wanted to check before I see if travel then might be a possibility for me. Please feel free to say no and we'll find another time if this isn't convenient for the agency. Thanks -- Linda

Linda -- Would you be interested in combining the GOMR sale with a Denver trip? We're wondering if it would work for you to fly to the sale on the 18th , fly to Denver the afternoon after the sale, Thursday briefings with royalty program, fly back to DC that evening. The other option could be that you fly out to Denver on Monday, Aug 17, meet with royalty folks Tuesday, departing that afternoon for New Orleans, Sale on Wed, the 19th ? Sarah Bittleman is interested in both legs of the trip and if both of you are interested in combining the two trips, that would

be helpful in terms of scheduling the Denver briefings .

Stratton, Sorry this took a little bit. I wanted to be sure we had everything you were looking for. The response below comes from our staff in the Gulf Region. Let me know if we can get you anything else. -Brad Repairs will be made by Shell Pipeline Company LP. Repairs most likely will require cutting the section of pipeline with the crack and replacement with a new section of pipeline in area of damage. Production will necessarily remain shut-in during these repairs. The oil spill was managed by US Coast Guard under a Unified Command consisting of members from Shell, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, with support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Coast Guard Capt. Joseph Paradis, federal on-scene commander for the Unified Command, indicated that he was ""pleased by the close cooperation shown by all of the organizations involved in the response."" The Eugene Island Pipeline system will be restarted following repairs and a thorough inspection. Top priorities during the response and restart phases are safety and the protection of the environment. MMS will accept/concur with the repair plan and review the repairs of all OCS pipelines under the provisions of the applicable ROW grant. MMS will not grant final approval of repairs to Shell Pipeline Company's Eugene Island pipeline since the pipeline is under the authority of the US Dept. of Transportation.
1

MMS is notified of the repair completion and will receive of copy of the report on final pipeline repairs. MMS is also notified when the operator returns to production. MMS inspectors can inspect facilities and observe the potential for oil sheens from helicopters while transiting to and from regular inspections in the Gulf of Mexico.

Brad, I wonder if you might be able to point this question in the right direction. When reading about the Eugene Island oil pipeline leak - it said any permanent repair must be approved by MMS. Who is handling this particular case and who would oversee final repair? Also, I have seen that the oil slick was cleaned up but have not seen if temporary repairs have been made. Have temporary repairs been made and if so, what are those repairs? Thanks for your help, Stratton K. Stratton Kirton Legislative Correspondent Office of Senator Bill Nelson (202) 224-5274

Summary '8 Amendments were enacted that require the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a 5-year plan for the timing and location of OCS lease sales. Jary 22, 1982, Secretary of the Interior James Watt designated the MMS as the administrative agency ;ible for the mineral leasing of submerged OCS lands and for the supervision of offshore operations Ise issuance. The MMS was created as a bureau of the 001 from parts of Bureau of Land ment and the U. S. Geological Survey. This was designed to end duplication of functions and more balance protection of the marine and coastal environments with developmental and security needs 3tion. 1982, the final 5-Year Plan was announced for 1982-1987

20, 1983, 000 and DOA entered into this agreement to resolve conflicts between the OCS leasing the requirements for the 000 to use the OCS for national defense and security. It sets forth Ires and steps to follow when OCS lease sales are planned and has been the basis for consultation in AFB concerning EGOM issues. Although theMOA does not mention the military mission line, lIy the military mission line was established through informal consultations under the MOA. January 1984, located south of 26? N latitude, no exploratory drilling activities were to be approved Department of the Interior accumulated three years' worth of physical oceanographic and biological ursuant to the MOA and subsequent stipulations (beginning with ""Stipulation No. 5"" in Lease Sale 79) I in all leases issued in the EGOM, the 001 and 000 agreed on a ""drilling window"" program to ensure loration activities could be conducted predictably, orderly and safely without interfering with scheduled activities or the national defense mission. December 1985, deferred the same blocks that were deferred in Sale 79 (discussed above), in to 2,814 blocks in water depths greater than 2,400 meters and 251 blocks in Military Warning Area 2,1987, Secretary Hodel approved the 5-Year LeaSing Program for 1987-1992 November 1988 and marked the last offshore offering sale held in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico until 1. 26, 1990, in response to a report from the Interagency OCS Task Force, President Bush announced Jrium on oil and gas leaSing off the Florida coast until after the year 2000.

United States of America with :) existing leases that had been subject to drilling moratoria and were located off the southwestern Florida, and offshore Alaska and North Carolina. The claimants contended that the Government was h of contract and that a ""taking"" of leaseholder's QroQerty rights had occurred. ber 1995, 73 oil and gas leases located south of 26 0 N. latitude were returned to the Federal nent as part of a litigation settlement. Consequently, no active Federal natural gas and oil leases exist 1west Florida. Likewise, no active lea,ses exist in the Straits of Florida Planning Area or off Florida's 1st (South Atlantic Planning Area). included one sale, Sale 181, proposed for the Eastern Gulf of Mexico in 2001. The original sale s carefully reviewed to be consistent with the State of Florida's opposition to offshore oil and gas ; within 100 miles of its coast and resQonded to concerns raised by the Governor of Alabama. tter part of 1996, a development plan was filed by Chevron U.S.A. and partners on the Destin Dome

12, 1998, President Clinton announced that he would withdraw from leasing through June 30, 2012, eas of the OCS under moratoria pursuant to section 108-11 of Public Law 105-83. In the Eastern Gulf :0, this amounted to withdrawing from leasing some 70 million acres or roughly 92 percent of the total I area. This prohibited preleasing, leasing, and related activities in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico 1 Area for any lands outside the proposed Sale 181 area, as described in the final OCS 5-Year Plan, 102. 24, 2000, Chevron U.S.A. and partners filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government for denying the ies ""timely and fair review"" of plans and permits, and an appeal concerned with its Destin Dome 56

2,2001, Interior Secretary Gale Norton announced that Sale 181 would be adjusted from 5.9 million , about 1.5 million acres or 256 blocks. The adjusted area lies more than 100 miles off the a/Florida State line. Sale 181 was held on December 5,2001 and MMS awarded 95 leases totaling r4,113. The military mission line was established during consultations with Eglin, pursuant to the )1 MOA, on Sale 181.

However, lpany declined its two awarded leases - De Soto Canyon Block 448 and De Soto Canyon Block 492. :tion resulted in the forfeiture of the 1/5th bonus bid deposit for each lease - $49,651.20 and .20, respectively. As a result, MMS netted a total amount of $6,595,753.40 for Lease Sale 197. lary 3,2006, MMS announced that it was setting Federal OCS offshore administrative boundaries State submerged lands for Department of the Interior planning, coordination, and administrative s using the principle of equidistance. The new boundary reallocated significant acreage from the Planning Area into the newly defined Central Planning Area. ) December 20, 2006, GOMESA of 2006 further impacted leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Area. This Act recognized the new Planning Area boundaries defined in the Draft Proposed OCS Oil ; Leasing Program 2007-2012 as well as the ""Military Mission Line."" The Military Mission line was as ""the north-south line at 86 degrees, 41 minutes W. longitude. The Act obligated MMS to offer the :!fined ""181 Area"" (portions of Central and Eastern Planning Areas) for lease as soon as practicable, ater than one year, after the date of enactment of the Act. While the Act opened new areas for it also instituted a new moratorium on ""leasing, preleasing or any related activity,"" until 2022 for: any st of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico; in Eastern Planning Area - any area within 125 Florida coast; and in Central Planning area - any area in Pensacola, Destin Dome, and Desoto within 100 miles of Florida coast. GOMESA also allows lessees to exchange leases under the new ium for royalty or bonus credits that can be used for a bonus bid for an OCS lease or a royalty due on lease.

If you need distances for all 10 of the closest producing leases, please let me know and I'll make sure to get that for you. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Cc: Haenny, Lesley Subject: RE: EGOM Leases

Steve, in response to your request on EGOM leases with expected expiration dates of 2041 and 2042. Basically: Those leases are subject to a ""drilling window"" stipulation. Those are 10 year leases and the lease clocks have only been running for a fraction of the 10 years. The calculated date assumes that they will only be running for 90 days every year and a half or so (whenever the drilling window opens). That's why the expected expiration dates are so far in the future. All of this is only an estimate, of course, as MMS and/or the Air Force could decide to change the window schedule at any time. Your inquiry of producing leases near FL was clearly stated; an incorrect interpretation of the request was the culprit. The Gulf Region folks are going back to provide you with the 5 GOM producing leases closest to the FL coast; we will also update the map. Enjoy the recess.

GOM lease map S-S-OB.pdf (1 ...

Thanks very much, Lyn. I have a couple of extra questions based on the spreadsheet - the Word document explains the agreement that suspends many of the leases until at least 2012, but there are also a lot of leases with expiration dates of 2041 and later. Were those part of the same agreement, and why did they did suspensions of that length? Also, I've included a map from last May that shows lease status in the GOM ... I can't find a similar producing/non-producing map like this on the website, so could we get an updated version of it (with red blocks for leases issued this year)? And I think I was a little . unclear when I asked for the closest producing leases to Florida - I was interested in the closest producing leases overall (including the CGOM), not just the EGOM . The map shows a bunch of them in the Mobile and Viosca Knoll planning areas that would be considerably closer than G1044 in DeSoto Canyon. Thanks again, --Steve

Worksheet 2 lists the 5 closest producing GOM leases. The Word document involves legal issues around the EGOM.

The Honorable Kenneth Salazar, Secretary U,S. Department of the Interior 1849 C Street, N\V. Room 6156 Washington, DC 20240 Dear Secretary Salazar: Weare writing to request your continued assistance in helping the State of Rl10dc Island
10 develop offshore wind energy.

For over a year, the State has been intensively engaged in applying its three-decades of experience in marine spatial planning (MSP) to adopt an ocean Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) designating sites in state and federal waters that may be appropriate for the development of offshore energy, specifically wind. Throughout this process, the state has worked coUaboratively with the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to ensure that its efforts are coordinated and consistent \vith federal policy. As a result, Rhode Island is poised to be among the first states in the nation to site and build wind energy in the otTshore area. We appreciate the steps you have already taken to establish a formal Task Force to help prepare for the upcoming leasing effort in federal waters off Rhode Island. We also understand that the State has requested that you keep Rhode Island OIl the same schedule as New Jersey by issuing a Rhode specific Request for Interest within the next few \>veeks. This Request for Interest will help start the proc.ess for potential leases. We urge you to give this request every consideration within all appEcable rules and regulations. As you know, the development of offshore wind energy ofTers important opportunities for Rhode Island to meet its goals for greenhouse gas reduction and renewable electricity generation. It also has the potential to create new economic opportunities for a stale with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Because of its efforts to develop its ocean SAMP, its native port faC'ilities. and skilled manufacturing and trades workforce, Rhode Island is in a position to be a leader andimponant example ofthc Obama Administration's support for a new green economy. In order to help facilitate this effort, we ask you to consider dedicating at least one MMS staff person to be posted in Rhode Island on a full-time basis to help assist in navigating the important decisions and procedural hurdles that must be cleared over the next several months.

We stand ready to meet with you to discuss this matter, and v,!e thank you lor your attention to this request and for the support that you have givcn to onshore rellewable energy development. We look forward to your timely responsc.

Sincerely,

United States Senator

Patrick J. Kennedy Member of Congress

Straits of Florida Leases (2) ....

Steve, The attached spreadsheet and map are responsive to your request on Straights of Florida leases. The location of the leases is complex as they were leased using the Marquesas map area which no longer exists. That area is now contained the Dry Tortugas Official Protraction Diagram but the blocks don't exactly correspond. The attached map overlays the Marquesas leases on the Dry Tortugas map. The well locations are known because of the x/y coordinates and lat/long data associated with the wells and they're also denoted on the Dry Tortugas map.

o o o o o

When has the SOF been included in a 5-Year Plan? In the 1987-1992 5-Year Plan Has industry ever shown interest in the area when solicited for comments, either through a DPP or other means; No recent SOF sale held due to lack of industry interest; one SOF sale held in 1959 Steve believes there were Federal leases issued in the SOF in 1959; how many and who were the lessees; (23 leases with lessees in attached spreadsheet; location in the attached map) Were exploration wells drilled and if so, where; and were there discoveries and if so, where (yes, 3 wells drilled also denoted in the attached spreadsheet and map) Were these leases relinquished or did the term expire; and when? (relinquished dates in spreadsheet)

Ryan, In response to your question about oil reserves being left in the ground . The OCSLA and MMS regulations are emphatic on the importance of conservation and increased ultimate recovery of oil and gas under sound engineering, environmental and economic principles. As per our discussion Friday, there are no regulations stating reserves are to be left in place at a certain percentage (which is impossible to know anyway) remaining . The citations below should help clear this up for the assemblyman's staffer. Thank you , Brad Here are some pertinent citations in our regs: 250.106 (c) Prevent damage to or waste of any natural resource, property, or the environment. 250.296 through 250.299 Conservation Information Documents . 250.1107 Enhanced oil and gas recovery operations

Robin, as a cc to Lesley's email, I wanted to offer one comment in response to your question. The 181 Sale Area South, as identified and opened for leasing and revenue sharing under GOMESA, is located in the Central Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. The August 19th Sale included acreage in the Western GOM Planning Area. Under the OCS Lands Act, revenues generated from leases within the 8(g) zone are shared with the adjacent state. In the case of the recent Western GOM Sale, 27% of the revenues from any new leases that are ultimately issued from this sale that are located within the 8(g) zone will be shared with TX.

Louisiana would get up to 27% (if the bonus bids are accepted and a lease is issued) based on the acreage of blocks leased in the Louisiana 8(g) zone. The Central Gulf of Mexico would also offer blocks in the Mississippi and Alabama 8(g) zones.

Hi Megan, Because yesterday's lease sale was in the Western Gulf of Mexico, Texas would get 27% of the bonus bids accepted on those leases in the 8(g) zone if the bonus bids are accepted. If you need anything else, please let me know. Thanks so much!

362617-mms2-pdf-70-171-173,"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF oes To INCLUDE THE U.S. TERRITORIES THROUGH CHANGES To THE oeSLA NOVEMBER 2,2009

Background: The Secretary of the Interior, through the MMS, has the authority to issue leases on the outer Continental Shelf (OCS) of the U.S. for four purposes: 1) to facilitate oil, gas and sulphur exploration and development; 2) to enable renewable energy development; 3) to utilize offshore sand and gravel resources to restore beaches and wetlands; and, 4) to facilitate the exploration and development of U.S. hard mineral resources (e.g., copper, manganese). This authority currently does not extend to the offshore territories and possessions of the U.S. If the OCS Lands Act is amended to extend the OCS and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to the U.S. Territories and possessions, the Secretary's authority to enable leasing of offshore resources would be extended into these areas.
The most likely minerals to be explored and developed in the waters off the U.S. territories and possessions would be base metals that occur as massive sulphide deposits in and around seafloor volcanoes, including copper, nickel, gold, silver, and small amounts of other metals. Companies likely to be interested in exploring and developing these deposits would include Nautilus Minerals, Inc., Neptune Minerals, Ltd., Anglo-American, and Teck Cominco, none of which are US corporations. However, Nautilus, Anglo, and Teck all have either a U.S. subsidiary or have operations in the U.S. Due to the geologic and geographic setting, the most likely minerals to be explored and developed in the waters off the U.S. territories and possessions would be base metals that occur as massive sulphide deposits in and around seafloor volcanoes, including copper, nickel, gold, silver, and small amounts of other metals. Companies likely to be interested in exploring and developing these deposits would include Nautilus Minerals, Inc., Neptune Minerals, Ltd., AngloAmerican, and Teck Cominco, none of which are US corporations. However, Nautilus, Anglo, and Teck all have either a U.S. subsidiary or have operations in the U.S. There are two Federal revenue sharing programs under the OCSLA that could be applicable to new leasing activities in Federal waters off the coast of the territories and possessions: 1) Section 8(g) of the OCSLA directs the Secretary to share with the affected coastal state 27% of the revenues generated from oil and natural gas leases issued wholly or partially within three nautical miles from the seaward boundary of any coastal state; and 2) Section 8(P) of the OCS Lands Act, directs the Secretary to share with the affected coastal state 27% of the revenues generated from renewable energy activities and those activities that support development or transportation of oil or natural gas located wholly or partially within the area extending three nautical miles seaward of the coastal State's submerged lands. There is no revenue sharing authority for OCS seabed mineral leasing activity.

Potential Economic Activity
o Income and Employment: The per capita income in all of the U.S. territories falls below that of any of the fifty states. An effective and active minerals development plan for the territories would be expected to generate incremental revenue, income and employment in the economically-challenged territories. . Domestic Production of Strategic Minerals: There are a number of strategic minerals that the U.S. imports from abroad. Domestic minerals production would be of strategic value in reducing the U.S. dependence on foreign mineral imports, and could lead to a reduction in the balance of payments to foreign governments by lessening the need for mineral imports. The exact number and extent of strategic minerals is not well known. It is also unknown how difficult it will be to mine these minerals offshore, particularly in areas far removed from traditional mining infrastructures, and in the very deep waters that surround most of the islands Minerals development is inherently financially risky, more so offshore. Mineral prices are volatile and the number of companies involved in offshore mining is small. The success of the program depends on the future prices of minerals and the financial viability of mining companies (and their ability to obtain financing). o Economic Diversification: Most of the territories are heavily dependent on only one or two key industries. Should offshore minerals mining become a significant industry, this could help to diversify the territorial economies. Renewable Energy Potential: The technologies which MMS is pursuing with respect to renewables, particularly wind technology, could be applied equally to the territories. Enable Sand and Gravel Program (where appropriate): Given that some territories are heavily dependent on tourism, the ability to maintain and replenish their beaches could be potentially valuable to some U.S. territories, particularly those in the Caribbean. Potential Resource Use Conflicts: There is the potential for conflict with other users of the open seas including fishing, shipping, aquaculture, renewable energy development, etc.

o

Increased Scientific Research and Incentive for Improved Technology
o Increased Knowledge of Resource Base: Exploration would provide the government new data which would increase its knowledge as to what resources are available within the territories and also how to best develop these resources. There is a possibility, of course, that such exploration would determine that the resources are less than expected and not viable for economic exploitation.

Page 2 of3

o

Improved Environmental Knowledge: All of the processes and procedures used by MMS (NEPA, EIS, etc.) to evaluate the environmental impacts of any proposed development would apply to the territories. New research would be undertaken to better understand the natural environments within the offshore territories. The assessments could also determine that the habitats are too fragile for the proposed resource extraction activities. Improved Technology: Active interest in the new areas would expand knowledge of seabed mineral deposits where little or no exploration has previously occurred, which creates a ripple effect of helping to find deposits in other deep seabed areas. Also this would help advance technologies for both exploration and development of minerals in the deep ocean floors, partiCUlarly for U.S. companies.

o

Revenues
o Increased Federal Revenues: If mineral leasing were to take place in the territories, the Federal government would obtain royalties, rents and bonus bids on minerals leased in the territories, all of which would be new income sources. Increased Territorial Revenues: Under current provisions, the territories with submerged lands could obtain revenues from renewable energy projects leased within three miles of the boundary of their submerged lands and see employment benefits from development activities if the areas are ultimately leased and developed.

o

Administrative
o DOIIMMS has Relevant Experience: MMS largely has the requisite regulations and procedures in place, as well as personnel that are qualified to manage this process. No Agency has Current Responsibility: There is currently no Federal agency that has responsibility for overseeing minerals development offshore of the U .S. territories. These resources cannot be evaluated, let alone developed, until some agency is given authority to manage the federal resources. Potential Administrative Conflict with Territories or with other Federal Agencies: Although the Office ofInsular Affairs (OIA), NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service all have some administrative role in managing territorial resources} The Secretary's current leasing authority, if the OCS Lands Act is extended to include the territories and possessions, would most likely apply only outside the limits of the territories' control and to areas not under the specific jurisdiction of any wildlife refuge, marine sanctuary or marine monument. The extent to which individual jurisdictions would be supportive of the construction of land-based storage or forwarding facilities is not known at this time and may vary among the jurisdictions.

o

o

t OIA provides technical and financial assistance to the territorial resource management agencies, but has no management authority with one exception. For the moment, OIA has default administrative responsibility for the waters off CNMI until Congress enacts legislation granting CNMI jurisdiction over its territorial waters consistent with the other 4 self-governing U.S. territories.

Apparently the Parish needed to make corrections in the official grant documents and the process is taking a little longer than anticipated. Once that is completed, then the process will continue to move forward and it is just a matter of getting everything lined up and correct. As soon as that process is completed, then the grant will be awarded, but as for right now, that is all the information I have. I hope this is information is helpful, if you need anything else, please let me know.

Kevin, I've attached a suggested itinerary from our Gulf office for what Senator Murkowski could expect from her brief trip to the Gulf region. Again, our Gulf office strongly suggests that this trip takes place in the early morning, as this time of year severe thunderstorms build up in the afternoon in the area. MMS has an excellent safety record, and the contracted helicopter pilots will not fly in bad weather. Because weather conditions can be unpredictable in the Gulf, a likely scenario that could happen is that the weather in the morning is perfect and by the time you get to one of the offshore platforms, a severe storm has moved into the area. In cases like this, the helicopter pilots will not fly off the platform until weather improves, so there is a chance that the Senator and COS could be stuck on a platform until the weather clears up. Please call me with any questions, concerns or updates you have regarding this trip. I look forward to hearing

Hi Kevin, Happy Friday! Hope you are doing well and that you have a fun weekend planned. (C) I was wondering if you had anymore info on Senator Murkowski's potential offshore trip? I have spoken with our New Orleans office, the office that would handle the trip and they gave me some details that I wanted to pass along to you. They would like to take the Senator to two different platforms, a production facility (drilling rig) and then a floating facility (this will take pretty much the entire day). They will try and find two that are close together to minimize time flying in the helicopter. While the helicopter may not be able to drop her off at Port Fourchon, our MMS staff will get her to Port Fourchon after the trip. That will not be a problem. I should know by next week whether or not the helicopter can drop her off there . Normally. a full offshore trip will take two days, and they always leave a day open for weather related issues. There will be some approval forms that will need to be filled out and sent back to me right away once this is

completely planned (which I can send to you if you want). I was also asked what the Senator will be doing while she is in Port Fourchon? Depending on what she will be doing, if she has any meetings, MMS works with many local and state entities in that area and could do a combined presentation for her while she is there . Do you have the dates confirmed yet? I know you originally told me the 25 th and 26 th, and I didn't realize until later that the 26 th was a Saturday. We can still do this if it's on Saturday, but I'm told there is much less staff around that day (on the rigs as well). Let's touch base either today or sometime next week if you can.

Thank you Karen. Yes, the attached updated itinerary reflects this schedule, dropping the Senator and you in Port Fourchon at the end of the offshore flight, around 5:00 pm . We are hoping to rearrange schedules so that Liz Birnbaum and Sarah Bittleman (Secretary's Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs) will join you and the Senator for the offshore trip. Will the Senator and you be involved in a tour of Port Fourchon Saturday evening? If yes, would the Senator be interested in having Liz and Sarah join you for that tour? I will be sending you information forms for both you and the Senator to fill out. The forms ask for personal information such as weight and shoe size; this information is needed for planning the helicopter flight and issuance of safety steel toed shoes for the tour of the offshore facility. Also, keep in mind that clothing worn for the offshore trip should be natural fiber shirts and pants, such as cotton shirts, jeans or khaki pants. There are changing room facilities at the Atlantic Aviation helicopter base. Lyn Herdt, Chief MMS Office of Congressional Affairs 202208-3502 (Office) 202208-3828 (Direct Line) 202 258-1702 (Cell)

362612-mms2-pdf-65-160-162,"The report acknowledged the challenges of operating ""what essentially is a business within the public sector"" and recommended that MMS explicitly recognize the commercial nature of the RIK Program. The Subcommittee also made recommendations regarding increasing the transparency of the RIK processes. The Subcommittee presented 31 separate recommendations regarding the RIK Program. The Department created an action plan to address the recommendations. Twelve of the RIK recommendations were completed as of July 2008. Many of the recommendations will be included in the RIK Strategic Business Plan for the years 2010-2012.

In testimony before the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee of the House Committee on Natural Resources, on March 11, 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) addressed four areas of concern regarding the RIK Program. GAO stated that: (1) the gas RIK Program does not have adequate assurance that it is collecting gas royalties owed, because it does not have the same production verification processes as the oil RIK Program; (2) MMS's measurement of RIK sales revenue performance did not account for uncertainty in estimates of in value payments; (3) MMS may be over or understating the value of early RIK payments due to assumptions on when in value payments are received and the interest rate used; and (4) information technology costs were excluded from the administrative cost comparison. MMS is taking steps to be responsive to GAO's concerns. The RIK Program is evaluating the gas production verification process in conjunction with the Offshore Minerals Management, and beginning in FY 2008, is evaluating reporting RIK revenue performance as a range to account for uncertainty in establishing fair market value. Regarding value of early payments, for FY 2007, MMS determined that the three percent rate used in its analysis was actually lower than the Federal funds rate and other measures of the time value of money. MMS will use the federal funds rate of return beginning in FY 2008 for its time value of money calculation. However, MMS has since verified its assumption that in value payments are rarely paid early. Furthermore, MMS does not agree that information technology (IT) costs should be included in the administrative cost comparison, since IT costs are highly variable for both the in kind and in value programs, rendering a cost comparison virtually meaningless. In May 2008, the Office of Inspector General (DIG) issued an evaluation report on the RIK Oil Sales Process. The DIG noted that MMS has taken some important and necessary steps to enhance the overall performance and effectiveness of the

28

RIK Program and has responded positively to recommendations contained in the RPC Report. The report also recommended six areas for improvement which included: (1) developing a comprehensive operations manual for the Crude Oil Front Office; (2) obtaining legal review of all existing contract documents; (3) developing guidelines for oil sales contracting; (4) addressing staffing needs, position qualifications, and training; (5) implementing a pilot project to evaluate the viability of other sales methods; and (6) using longer term oil sales contracts. MMS agreed with recommendations (1) through (4) and is taking steps to implement them. For recommendations (5) and (6), MMS will evaluate alternative sales methods to determine if a pilot project would be appropriate and will evaluate the benefit of offering longer term oil sales contracts in its upcoming sale in August 2008. The MMS looks forward to continuing the RIK Program and making it a stronger, even more successful program during FY 2008 and beyond.

Conclusions and Preview of FY 2008

Fiscal Year 2007 was a dynamic year for the RIK Program. The RIK Crude Oil Program saw the resumption of the SPR Program resulting in changes in the other oil programs. The RIK Natural Gas Program experienced large changes with the addition of five new sales packages to the Gulf of Mexico Program and two new packages to the Wyoming Program. FY 2008 looks to be another successful and dynamic year for the RIK Program. While the RIK Program does not plan to add any additional sales packages to either the Crude Oil or Natural Gas Programs, additional volumes may be added to current sales packages in the Natural Gas Program. The Wyoming natural gas sales packages will continue to grow in volume as production increases in the area . The MMS will also begin to utilize its long-haul transportation on the Rockies Express Pipeline during FY 2008. Also important during FY 2008, will be evaluating and implementing the changes recommended by external and internal reviews of the RIK Program. In March 2007, the Subcommittee on Royalty Management (Subcommittee) was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an independent prospective examination of the MMS's Minerals Revenue Management program, including a review of the Royalt? in Kind Program. The Subcommittee's report was published in December 2007. 1 The review of the RIK Program confirmed that there are clear advantages to the RIK approach, acknowledging the benefits described earlier in this annual report. The Subcommittee also made a number of recommendations regarding challenges that the RIK Program needs to address. The Subcommittee provided recommendations in six major areas regarding the RIK Program. o Growth of the RIK Program, o Market position, organizational structure, and incentives, o The RIK Crude Oil Program, o Personnel breadth and depth, o Performance measures, and o RIK auction procedures.

Most importantly, the pilots confirmed the viability of the RIK approach and its use in tandem with the RIV approach. In January 2001, MMS management decided to proceed with the development of a permanent RIK operational activity. The Road Map to the Future: Implementing Royalty in Kind Business Processes and Support Systems (Road Map) set forth the strategic direction for the development of the RIK process and the resources needed to effectively manage and support ongoing RIK operations. The MMS developed and implemented core operational processes and expanded the pilot operations . In January 2003, MMS engaged the Lukens Energy Group to evaluate the capabilities and performance of the RIK Program. The Lukens Energy Group recommended improvements in several areas prior to any significant expansion of the RIK Program. These improvements included performance measurement, quantitative economic analysis, and the enhancement of complex marketing and sales strategies. With the input from the Lukens Energy Group, MMS published the Five Year Royalty in Kind Business Plan (Five Year Plan) to guide RIK business through 2009. This marked the transition of the RIK Program from pilot projects to a permanent RIK Program.

RIK Business Model/Organization

RIK Business Model The RIK Program's commercial business model and core operational procedures were developed in the Road Map and in the expanded pilot operations. The business model was designed according to statutory authorities and positions MMS as a conservative, price-taker seller of energy commodities into the wholesale, upstream market. The business model features the use of:
o o o o o Competitive sales based on upstream physical spot markets, Standard industry contracts for less than 1 year in duration, Competitively based transportation and processing contracts, No fixed price, financial derivatives, or storage positions, and Conservative credit risk assessments.

4

In addition to the core RIK business model, the Five Year Plan laid out a set of guiding business principles for the RIK Program. The RIK business principles are to: o Meet or exceed revenue benchmarks, using a portfolio approach, established in accordance with statute, o Maximize net revenue for RIK volumes consistent with the business model, o Continue to focus on the Gulf of Mexico as a strategic core area, and work with producing states to identify/develop onshore opportunities, o Efficiently manage administrative costs of the RIK Program, o Maintain flexibility in responding to the Nation's strategic energy initiatives, and o Maintain the highest ethical and professional standards. RIK Program Organization and Staff The RIK Program organization was designed to mirror industry-standard structure, with strong internal controls. This structure includes separate front offices for asset management activities, back offices for accounting activities, a mid office for credit monitoring, and an economic analysis office for performance measurement and other analytical activities. The Economic Analysis Office and Mid Office report directly to the RIK Program Director while the Front and Back Offices report to the Deputy Program Manager. The RIK operations are supported by the MMS Procurement Office. The MMS Procurement Office manages all supporting transportation and processing contracts that fall under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The MMS Procurement Office is not shown on the organizational chart below, as it is independent of the RIK Program .

This organizational RIK Staff by Office structure provides for clear separation of Back Office 29 duties designed to focus and optimize Front Office functional expertise while ensuring strong Md Office internal controls. Implementation of the Economic Analy.;is Five Year Plan has led to significant growth in the size of the RIK Program Staff Program staff and in the skill set of the RIK Program employees. The RIK Program maintains a staff with skills in commercial sales , marketing, transportation, scheduling, accounting, economic analysis, and contract administration. The number of staff in each office during FY 2007 is shown in the chart. The RIK Program is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado, with a satellite office in Houston, Texas. Most Gulf of Mexico RIK industry counterparties and service providers have their offices in the Houston area. Maintaining a Houston presence facilitates effective working relationships with industry counterparties. A front office presence in Houston is also essential to successfully attract required expertise needed to fully staff the office. Currently, there are three Natural Gas Front Office positions, two Back Office positions, and one Mid Office position in the Houston RIK Program office.

Five Year Business Plan Goals The Five Year Plan set out a number of measurable commercial objectives and efficiency goals for the RIK Program.
The original commercial objectives are to: o Realize maximum benefits by optimizing RIK volumes: o RIK Natural Gas - initial goal to grow to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day in FY 2009 (revised to 825,000 thousand cubic feet per day), o RIK Crude Oil - maintain static volumes of up to 190,000 barrels per day through FY 2009, o Initial goal to enhance net revenue by $50 million over 5 years (revised to $125 million), and o Develop a high quality marketing portfolio by the following diversification: o Customers: Increase sales to utilities/industrials to 20 percent of all natural gas sales o Contracts: Increase non-seasonal sales to 35 percent of all natural gas sales. The goal to increase net revenue has been revised since the Five Year Plan was published. In order to take into account the administrative cost savings and the time value of money benefit, the initial $50 million goal was first increased to $67.5 million. After reaching $67.1 million at the end of FY 2006, the goal was revised upward to $125 million. In addition, at the beginning of FY 2008, MMS revised the natural gas volume goals set forth in the Five Year Plan due to production declines, royalty relief issues, and other priorities. The table below shows the original and revised volume goals/projections for FY 2006 - FY 2009.
Revised Natural Gas Volume Goals (MMBtu/day) Five Year Plan Goal Actual/Revised Goal 3 650,000 493,733 FY 2006 800,000 763,000 FY 2007 950,000 800,000 FY 2008 1,050,000 825,000 FY 2009

The MMS is also working towards other goals laid out in the Five Year Plan and has made significant progress towards portfolio diversification and is working towards the other administrative goals.

FY 2007 Process Improvements During FY 2007, MMS implemented many improvements to processes and policies within the RIK Program. These improvements include: o Specific procedures about bid acceptance during RIK sales, o Clearly defined roles and responsibilities during the RIK sale process,

Specific documentation requirements regarding the decision making process during RIK sales and improved record keeping, Strengthened internal controls in all of the RIK processes, Coordination with the MMS Procurement Office, and Procedures for information sharing and volume reconciliations between the RIK Program and the MMS Compliance and Asset Management Program.

Credit Policy A sound credit policy is central to the success of the RIK Program. The credit policy, completed in June 2005, responds to credit risks inherent in energy commodity sales. The policy provides guidance and direction for counterparty credit evaluation, requirements for secured versus unsecured credit lines, provision of credit assurance, contract termination, and emergency procedures. During FY 2007, the Mid Office put a new credit-scoring model into use for determining appropriate credit lines for RIK counterparties. Risk Management Policy Policy oversight plays a large role in the risk management policies of the RIK Program. The Chief Risk Officer manages the oversight activities and reports directly to the Minerals Revenue Management Associate Director and the MMS Executive Committee. The RIK also has risk management policies and procedures to implement key internal controls. The Royalty in Kind Risk Management Policy (Policy) outlines the principles and policies that drive risk management decisions and guide day-to-day RIK operations. The subsequent Risk Management Procedures Manual (Procedures) outlines the specific actions necessary to implement the policy.
The Policy provides a framework to: o Balance risk management and operational flexibility, o Mitigate exposure to and results of undesirable outcomes, o Assign responsibilities and accountability for risk management, and o Monitor and report on risk exposures. The Procedures: o Delegate authorities for: o Transacting sales, o Accounting, o Invoicing, o Collecting debt, and o Monitoring and reporting, o Provide clear and detailed guidance on sales and transactions allowed, those requiring further approval, and those that are prohibited, o Outline monitoring and reporting responsibilities, and o Include an attestation of compliance with risk management policies.

Partners The RIK Program works with a number of different federal agencies, states, and industry partners to accomplish its mission. These partners are critical to the success of the RIK Program. The RIK Program currently partners, or has partnered, with the following organizations: o Department of Energy (DOE) in the joint effort to fill the remaining capacity of the SPR, o The State of Wyoming on crude oil sales from both Federal and state leases and natural gas sales from Federal leases, o The States of Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama on natural gas and/or crude oil in 8(g) zones offshore, and o The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on sales of natural gas produced from the National Helium Reserve as the reserve is decommissioned. 3 RIK Performance Metrics

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act mandates that MMS receive at least fair market value when production is sold in kind. The benefits of using the RIK strategy include the lower administrative costs, time value of money benefit, and increased royalty revenues. Within the RIK Program, the Economic Analysis Office (EAO) is a separate, independent group that measures and reports performance. The EAO staff computes performance on a semi-annual basis with performance results reported to the public annually. In FY 2007, MMS estimates the total value of the benefits of the RIK Program was $63.2 million.
Total Benefits of RIK Program FY 2004 Administrative Savings $1,447,051 Time Value of Money $892,875 Revenue Performance $17,242,415 Total Benefits $19,582,341

Administrative Cost Performance

The MMS performs an annual comprehensive comparative cost analysis between administering the RIK and RIV Programs. In the RIV Program, MMS is required to validate the value and transportation costs associated with the sales and movement of Federal production . These requirements can be very labor intensive due to the complexity of the business practices surrounding hundreds of mineral lessees and applying valuation regulations defining royalty payment standards. Royalties taken in kind through the RIK Program are sold under explicit commercial contract terms. These standard industry contracts provide a level of transparency in the valuation and transportation of royalties taken in kind which typically lead to a more efficient process with decreased conflicts and costs. These differences equate to a potential cost savings through taking royalties in kind versus in value.
9

FY 2007 was the fourth year in which MMS performed this analysis. The RIK Program decreased its administrative costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE)4 slightly in FY 2007. 5
Administrative Cost Royalty in Kind Cost Per BOE Royalty in Value Cost Per BOE . Cost Per BOE Difference RIK Revenue Gain/Loss FY 2004 $0.056 $0 .073 $0.017 $1,447,051 FY 2005 $0.059 $0 .102 $0.043 $3,725,372 FY 2006 $0 .076 $0.108 $0.033 $2,368,227 FY 2007 $0 .071 $0 .114 $0.043 $3,553,392

The increased efficiency due to the RIK Program translates into a cost savings of $3.55 million for FY 2007. Meaning, if offshore volumes allocated to the RIK Program were instead taken in value, an additional cost of $3.55 million would have been accrued. 6 As part of the administrative cost analysis, MMS examines the number of appeals between the RIK and RIV Programs. Of the 63 pending administrative appeals in FY 2007, none were associated with the RIK Program. The number of appeals is a direct measurement of the potential for litigation and thus cost. Additionally, the time taken to close accounting periods in the RIK Program is significantly lower compared to the RIV business cycle of 3 years. For FY 2007, MMS reconciled nearly 87 percent of RIK delivery volumes within 180 days of the month of production.

3.2

Time Value of Money

Revenue Collection Time (RCT) is a measure of the number of days after each production month that MMS takes to collect outstanding receivables. Payments in the RIK Program are received on average 5 and 10 days before the end of the month following production for gas and oil respectively, which gives MMS an RCT between 20 and 25 days. 7 Conversely, RIV payments are due at the end of the month following the month of production, which gives RIV an RCT of 30 to 31 days.8 The difference in RCT
4

The barrel of oil equivalent measure converts natural gas volumes into barrels by assuming 5.8 MMBtu of natural gas has the same heating content as one barrel of oil. 5 RIV payments are audited 3 years after the production year; therefore royalties paid in calendar year (CY) 2004 were audited during CY 2007 . Therefore, the RIV costs use 2004 BOE volumes as a basis for the cost per BOE. 6 Administrative cost savings are only calculated for the offshore RIK volumes . Wyoming is the only state that MMS has royalties in kind and onshore RIV administrative costs are not tracked by state. 7 The time value of money calculations are made based on the actual day RIK payments are received . 8 An analysis of RIV payments made during FY 2007 showed that the vast majority of payments were received at the end of the month and are not made prior to the due date.

10

between RI K and RIV provides a time value of money component. Because these payments are received earlier than they would have otherwise been received in the RIV Program, a time value of money (TVM) component is calculated on RIK payments using the number of days for which early payment was made at an annual interest rate of 3 percent. 9
RIK Time Value of Money Benefit FY 2004 TVM Earned - Oil $461,030 TVM Earned - Gas $431,845 Total TVM Earned - RIK $892,875 Total TVM per BOE $0.010

FY 2005 $1,023,548 $505,002 $1,528,550 $0.026

FY 2006 $1,996,859 $636,611 $2,633,470 $0.035

FY 2007 $2,306,589 $782,483 $3,089,072 $0.034

The TVM component provided an additional revenue gain from the RIK Program of $3.1 million or 3.4 cents per barrel of oil equivalent in FY 2007.

3.3

Revenue Performance

The RIK Program can use its position in many markets to realize higher royalty revenue than MMS would expect to earn through RIV. These higher revenues come from more favorable natural gas processing contracts, increased competition, and aggregated production. The RIK Program has a well-defined process using economic modeling to measure and record overall RIK revenue performance. This detailed process was developed with the assistance of Lukens Energy Group. Although minor adjustments and modifications have altered the models in their 4-year application, the general approach and calculation process has not changed.

The MMS computes a fair market value (FMV) benchmark range 10 specific to either oil or natural gas, and compares it to the RIK sales. This FMV benchmark is an approximation of what the average third-party may have sold the same production for and estimates what MMS would expect to see on average through RIV.

9 The MMS is currently evaluating the methodology for calculating the interest rate to be used in future time value of money analyses. During FY 2007, the Federal Funds Rate averaged 5.2 percent and the six-month Treasury bill rate averaged 4.77 percent; therefore, the 3 percent rate used may be a very conservative rate and understate actual time value of money benefits. 10 The MMS is currently evaluating reporting RIK revenue performance as a range for FY 2008.

This table and chart display total RIK revenues and the corresponding revenue gains for each year since FY 2004. As shown below, returns as a percentage of total RIK revenues have remained steady at approximately 1.2 percent for Fiscal Years 2004, 2005, and 2007 . Returns were lower in FY 2006 due to specific market cond itions in the crude oil market and the hurricanes of fall 2005.

The RIK Program continues to see high participation in its natural gas sales . In FY 2007, there were 25 sales packages in the RIK Natural Gas Program sold to 20 different counterparties. These sales were supported by approximately 90 transportation, processing, and other service contracts during FY 2007. The chart below details participation information for recent Gulf of Mexico natural gas sales to illustrate the high level of competition for RIK natural gas.

Gulf of Mexico RIK Natural Gas Program

The Gulf of Mexico RIK Natural Gas Program began with the first RIK Natural Gas pilots. The current program consists of 22 sales packages. The MMS has achieved a 1 to 2 percent revenue gain on RIK natural gas sales over the past 4 years. The MMS makes money under the RIK Natural Gas Program due in large part to decreased costs under RIK processing and transportation contracts. For example, in situations where producers have long-term obligations to a specific pipeline and/or processing plant, MMS can obtain a lower rate with a different pipeline and/or plant. However, the program can also make money by obtaining premiums to index prices, because RIK purchasers gain access to attractive downstream markets using RIK transportation contracts. Overall natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is declining rapidly, leaving much of the transportation and processing facilities underutilized, increasing competition for natural gas that is not part of a long-term commitment.

Conversions of Gulf of Mexico Leases from RIV to RIK in FY 2007 In FY 2007, the MMS converted five new natural gas packages, containing 109 leases, in the Gulf of Mexico adding significant volume and revenue to the RIK Natural Gas RIK Natural Gas Program Program, as Volume and Revenue shown in the 255 chart. The $2,500 conversions were I based on 52,000 I , comprehensive $1,500 analyses, which 11 {!. showed that all 55 would at least be revenue neutral $500 (RIK payments are expected to be equal to what we would expect to receive in value). The MMS converts properties to RIK only when it can be demonstrated through detailed economic analysis that RIK revenues would equal or exceed the revenues received in value. When analysis does not support revenue neutrality or benefit, properties are not converted. Besides revenue benefits, RIK conversion can also result in administrative cost savings and time value of money benefits.

Dauphin Island Gathering System (DIGS) The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for six meters (12 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 16,000 MMBtu/day on the Dauphin Island Gathering System (DIGS) starting November 1, 2006. Duke Energy Field System (DEFS) operates DIGS, which moves gas from the Mobile, Viosca Knoll, and Main Pass areas in the Gulf of Mexico to DEFS's Mobile Bay processing plant onshore and downstream markets. The DIGS package included three meters containing Alabama 8(g) production. The MMS viewed the DIGS RIK conversion as commercially revenue neutral because MMS negotiated the same transportation and processing rates as the producers. However, the DIGS portfolio showed revenue gains because MMS sold the DIGS natural gas at premiums to the fair market value benchmarks. The RIK purchaser on DIGS was able to offer a price higher than index, because they could use MMS's DIGS transportation contract to access numerous downstream markets, thus providing them with greater flexibility to resell the gas in the highest priced market. Destin Pipeline The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for six meters (24 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 75,000 MMBtu/day on BP Pipeline's Destin Pipeline starting November 1, 2006. Destin transports production from the Viosca Knoll and Main Pass areas to the BP-operated Pascagoula Gas Plant onshore. The MMS paid transportation and processing rates comparable to other parties. However, the Destin portfOlio showed revenue gains because MMS sold the Destin natural gas at premiums to the fair market

14

value benchmarks. Like DIGS, MMS believes we achieved this premium because our Destin transportation contract provided the purchaser flexibility to resell the gas in the most advantageous market. Discovery Gas Transmission The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for nine meters (18 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 30,000 MMBtu/day on the Discovery Gathering and Transmission Pipelines beginning November 1, 2006. This pipeline transports natural gas production from the South Timbalier, Grand Isle, Ewing Bank, Green Canyon, and Mississippi Canyon areas offshore of Louisiana. The MMS pays the same average transportation rate as producers. The MMS also received a firm transportation rate to guarantee delivery from Discovery into the market with the highest net value. Processing takes place at the LaRose Gas Plant, where MMS received a processing rate equal to or better than the producers. The MMS converted this production to RIK due to the opportunity to move the gas to a market with a higher value, with revenue neutral transportation and processing costs. Sea Robin Gas Pipeline The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for fifteen meters (22 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 27,800 MMBtu/day on the Sea Robin Gas Pipeline System starting November 1, 2006. Sea Robin transports natural gas from the East Cameron, Vermilion, South Marsh Island, and Eugene Island areas offshore of Louisiana to the Amerada Hess-owned Sea Robin Gas Plant and downstream markets. The MMS received transportation and processing rates equal to the producers, making this at least a revenue neutral portfolio. Tennessee (Grand Chenier) Gas Pipeline System The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK for twelve meters (33 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 11,700 MMBtu/day on the Tennessee Pipeline starting November 1, 2006. The production is from the East Cameron, West Cameron, and Vermilion areas of offshore Louisiana and it includes three leases from the Louisiana 8(g) zone. The Tennessee Gas Pipeline is a free-pooling pipeline, meaning there are no transportation charges. Gas was temporarily processed at Targa Resources' Lowry Gas Plant until the Grand Chenier Plant was rebuilt after damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The MMS expected this portfolio to be revenue neutral to possibly revenue positive depending on the processing rate received at the Grand Chenier Plant.

Onshore RIK Natural Gas Program

The onshore natural gas RIK Program consists of two programs: sales from the decommissioning of the National Helium Reserve on behalf of BLM and sales of natural gas from Federal leases in the State of Wyoming.

BlM National Helium Reserve The MMS sells approximately 9,000 MMBtu/day of Federal natural gas produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU) on behalf of BLM. The CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas near the city of Amarillo. As the helium reserve is drawn down, natural gas is produced. Revenues from these sales are collected by BLM and are not reported in RIK revenues or performance metrics because the natural gas is not royalty gas. Wyoming The major component of the onshore RIK Natural Gas Program is production from three major fields in the State of Wyoming. The MMS takes Federal royalties in kind from the Madden, Jonah, and Pinedale Anticline fields. The first production taken in kind was from the Madden field beginning in April 2006. In January 2007, production from the Jonah and Pinedale fields was added to the onshore RIK Natural Gas Program. Conversions of Onshore Natural Gas leases from RIV to RIK in FY 2007 In FY 2007, the MMS converted two natural gas packages, containing 47 leases, in Wyoming, adding significant volume and revenue to the RIK Natural Gas Program.
Jonah Field (Opal) The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK from 41 lease/agreements totaling approximately 100,000 MMBtu/day from the Jonah field in Wyoming's Green River Basin beginning January 1, 2007. The Jonah Gas Gathering System transports this gas south into the Williams' Opal Gas Plant, Enterprise's Pioneer Gas Plant, or into Anadarko's Rendezvous Gathering System. The MMS converted this production to RIK because MMS was able to obtain a processing contract at the available gas plant that is expected to add significant value. Pinedale Anticline The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK from six leases totaling approximately 20,000 MMBtu/day from the Pinedale field also in the Green River Basin of Wyoming beginning January 1, 2007. The Questar Gas Management (QGM) gathering system transports the gas from the field south into the QGMoperated Black's Fork Gas Plant. The MMS converted this production because the RIK sales price could be higher than the non-arm's-Iength value reported by the producers.

Revenue Performance FY 2007 was a very successful year for the RIK Natural Gas Program in Wyoming. Summary results are shown below. The RIK Natural Gas Wyoming Program achieved significant gains from the favorable processing rates and pricing terms received. 11

Long-Term Strategy In order to realize higher longRockies Express Pipeline term royalty revenues from the Wyoming RIK Natural Gas Program, MMS entered into its first long haul transportation contract on the Rockies Express Pipeline (REX) jointly owned by Kinder Morgan, Sempra, and ConocoPhillips. This decision, based on extensive study of the Wyoming natural gas markets, involved both MMS staff and Map courtesy of Kinder Morgan outside commercial and legal consultants. The REX will transport natural gas from the Opal hub in Wyoming to delivery points in the Northeast. Expected completion of REX to Clarington, Ohio is January 2009. Interim service will provide midcontinent delivery points in spring 2008.
Transportation discounts, favorable pricing terms, and percentage-of-proceeds 12 processing contracts contribute to the success of the Wyoming RIK Program to date. The RIK Program Front Office staff has gained important market knowledge through this program as onshore markets are much less transparent than the Gulf of Mexico market. This knowledge will become even more important as MMS analyzes the best way to leverage its REX contract into the future.

The loss in FY 2006 was due to diversification of pricing terms on portion of the sales volume. In percentage-of-proceeds processing contracts, the producer pays the plant operator a fee based on a percentage of the value of the liquids extracted from the natural gas, rather than a flat fee.

RIK Crude Oil Program

The RIK Crude Oil Program consists of three main sUb-programs: o The Unrestricted Program (Gulf of Mexico and Pacific), o The Small Refiner Program, and o The Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program (SPR). The detailed histories of the three main sub-programs listed above follow. The Wyoming RIK Crude Oil Program began as a pilot project and was discontinued in April 2006. Declining production volumes inhibited the Wyoming RIK Crude Oil Program's ability to realize administrative cost savings. Also, changing crude oil market conditions in the state, due to low export capacity, made potential purchasers reluctant to enter into term contracts.

The RIK Program continues to experience healthy competition in its offshore crude oil sales. In FY 2007, RIK conducted six separate sales and received competitive bids from 19 different companies. Sales packages were sold to 11 different counterparties during the year. These sales were supported by over a dozen transportation and other service contracts during FY 2007. Below is a chart detailing the changes in total volumes and revenues in the RIK Crude Oil Program from FY 2004 through FY 2007. Volumes have remained relatively constant in the Small Refiner and Unrestricted Pacific Programs. The Unrestricted Gulf of Mexico Program has experienced the most change in volumes over the years due to the SPR Program. The volumes that have been used to fill the SPR have come out of the Unrestricted Gulf of Mexico Program.

Unrestricted Oil Program

As the name implies, there are no mandated eligibility requirements to participate in this program. Any and all companies meeting basic credit requirements are eligible to participate. Over the years, there have been many diverse participants in this program, from major oil companies to financial holding companies. This program is subject to the most volume fluctuations as its volumes have often been diverted to the SPR over the past 4 years. The majority of the eligible leases in the Gulf of Mexico are being taken in kind and there have been very few new leases converted to RIK status in recent years. As new major production projects in the Gulf of Mexico begin producing, they become candidates for RIK. The last example of this was the Mad Dog and Holstein projects in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico that began producing in 2005. There are several new projects that are expected to begin producing soon that may be considered for the RIK Program. Below is a summary of the revenue performance measurements for the Unrestricted Program over the past 4 years. Returns were lower in FY 2006 due to specific market conditions in the crude oil market and the hurricanes of fall 2005. In FY 2007, the Gulf Unrestricted Program realized revenue gains above fair market value of more than $11 million, a substantial increase over the previous year. These gains are primarily attributable to: (1) RIK benefitting from crude oil price increases during FY 2007, because RIK crude oil sales contracts use ""calendar month"" pricing instead of earlier ""trade month"" pricing used in some industry sales contracts; and (2) RIK obtaining premiums from purchasers on certain crude packages for which the purchaser entered into lucrative downstream financial transactions and passed on a portion of those benefits to RIK.

Pacific Unrestricted Oil Program The Pacific RIK Crude Oil Program originally began as part of the Small Refiner Program. In late 2005, many of the small refiners either no longer qualified for the program or were no longer interested in bidding on the Pacific RIK production . As a result, the production was moved to the Unrestricted Program.

19

Currently, approximately 6,000 barrels per day are taken in kind from one offshore field, Santa Ynez. In previous years, two other offshore fields were included, Dos Cuadras and the Grace Units. The revenue gain per barrel has always been significant in this program due to the strategic location of the production and the unique demand for this supply. The location is remote from foreign oil delivery points. The production is also directly connected via pipeline to the refinery in the local area. Due to both of these factors, this production has a significant competitive advantage.

Small Refiner Program

began in the 1970s as a program designed to assist . domestic small refiners by providing a reliable supply of crude oil at equitable prices. Historically, these eligible refiners have supplied U.S. military operations with jet fuel and other energy needs on military bases. Because these small refiners typically do not have any production of their own, the RIK Small Refiner Program has served an important role in helping small refiners acquire feed stock. A Small Refiner, as defined at 30 CFR section 208.2, means a refiner of crude oil with a total operable atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity of less than or equal to 125,000 barrels per calendar day, and fewer than 1,500 employees. In FY 2007, MMS sold all RIK packages in its Small Refiner Program for a term of 1 year, providing a revenue gain of $3 million or 24 cents per barrel of oil.

attributed to a lack of interest and a more competitive market, forcing a number of small refiners to merge thus becoming ineligible for the program. In accordance with 30 CFR 208.4,14 MMS performed a Determination of Need for the Small Refiner Program. The evaluation was completed in June 2008 and recommended a need for the Small Refiner Program. This is the third time MMS has conducted a full analysis ..

Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program

The MMS partners with the DOE to fill the remaining capacity of the SPR. In order to receive crude oil that meets the quality specifications for the SPR sites, DOE uses RIK oil in exchange contracts. The MMS arranges for delivery of the royalty oil from offshore production facilities to onshore market centers and then transfers the production to DOE. The DOE then contracts with industry partners to exchange the royalty oil for oil of the appropriate specifications at SPR sites. The MMS previously worked with DOE to add crude oil to the SPR from 1999 to 2000 and 2002 to 2005. This effort brought the volume of the SPR to 700 million barrels. The MMS and DOE began the current SPR fill initiative in July 2007 to fill the SPR to its capacity of 727 million barrels. MMS suspended delivery of RIK oil for the current initiative at the end of June 2008. Below is the volume and estimated market value of the production transferred to DOE for SPR purposes. This information is as reported in the MMS Annual Financial Reports. 15

Energy Policy Act of 2005 Report Requirements

The report covers the information required by Section 342 (e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct). The EPAct requires that for each of fiscal years 20062015 in which the United States takes oil or gas royalties in kind from production in any State or from the outer Continental Shelf (OCS), excluding royalties taken in kind and sold to refineries under subsection (h), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that describes: (A) the one or more methodologies used by the Secretary to determine compliance with subsection (d),16 including the performance standard for comparing amounts received by the United States derived from royalties in kind to amounts likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value; (8) an explanation of the evaluation that led the Secretary to take royalties in kind from a lease or group of leases, including the expected revenue effect of taking royalties in kind; (C) actual amounts received by the United States derived from taking royalties in kind and costs and savings incurred by the United States associated with taking royalties in kind, including administrative costs savings and any new or increased administrative costs; and (D) an evaluation of other relevant public benefits or detriments associated with taking royalties in kind.

(A) Methodologies to Compare RIK and RIV values Conversion from RIV to RIK The MMS completes a financial analysis to determine whether a property should be converted to RIK using public industry information, pipeline system maps, energy publications, transportation routes, processing options, downstream
16 Subsection (d) states that ""Benefit to the Unites States Required-The Secretary may receive oil or gas royalties in-kind only if the Secretary determines that receiving royalties in-kind provides benefits to the United States that are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in-value.""

22

marketing routes, and index pricing . This research is focused on each property's existing economic case or royalty in value payments and the potential options for economic improvement. The MMS includes transportation and/or processing bids in building this economic case. A comparison of the dollar amount the Federal Government is currently receiving in value along with the calculated value that would be received in kind is performed. Prior to conversion, MMS completes a conversion document recommending whether the pipeline/properties should be converted to in kind which contains pipeline maps showing properties analyzed, spreadsheet analysis comparing RIK economics versus RIV reported economics and the technical written economic case. Revenue Performance Metrics Given the fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayer, MMS measures the performance of the RIK Program against a calculated Fair Market Value (FMV) benchmark that approximates the royalty value that the RIV Program would have received. Market price and basis volatility create risk exposure that RIK performance could be below the FMV benchmark due to the difference between the pricing mix used by RIK for selling the commodity and the pricing mix used in the FMV benchmark. The MMS computes the FMV benchmark range specific to the commodity, and uses this as the performance standard for measuring RIK performance. To compute the FMV benchmark, MMS establishes a benchmark price that reflects major liquid pricing point(s) proximal to RIK properties. This benchmark price is adjusted to reflect transportation, quality, processing, and various marketing possibilities and any adjustments that may have been derived from RIV or other commercial market transactions. This results in a FMV benchmark for comparison to RIK actual values, netted back to the lease. These measures meet statutory requirements to reflect commercial fair market value and a proxy for RIV. They recognize fair market value as a range of values, differentiate between forward-looking decision analysis and backward-looking measurement, use as much RIV data as possible, and use RIV data to calibrate commercial market data. (See Section 3.3 Revenue Performance in this report for more information.) (8) Evaluation Supporting Conversion of Leases to RIK Status in FY 2007 The MMS converted seven different natural gas sales packages, containing 156 leases, and one crude oil property during FY 2007. This information was presented in sections 4 .1 and 4.2 for the natural gas program and section 5.3 for the crude oil program. It is also presented below.

23

Gulf of Mexico Natural Gas Conversions (see Section 4.1) Dauphin Island Gathering System (DIGS) The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for six meters (12 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 16,000 MMBtu/day on the Dauphin Island Gathering System (DIGS) starting November 1, 2006. Duke Energy Field System (DEFS) operates DIGS, which moves gas from the Mobile, Viosca Knoll, and Main Pass areas in the Gulf of Mexico to DEFS's Mobile Bay processing plant onshore and downstream markets. The DIGS package included three meters containing Alabama 8(g) production. The MMS viewed the DIGS RIK conversion as commercially revenue neutral because MMS negotiated the same transportation and processing rates as the producers. However, the DIGS portfolio showed revenue gains because MMS sold the DIGS natural gas at premiums to the fair market value benchmarks. The RIK purchaser on DIGS was able to offer a price higher than index, because they could use MMS's DIGS transportation contract to access numerous downstream markets, thus providing them with greater flexibility to resell the gas in the highest priced market.
Destin Pipeline The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for six meters (24 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 75,000 MMBtu/day on BP Pipeline's Destin Pipeline starting November 1 ,2006. Destin transports production from the Viosca Knoll and Main Pass areas to the BP-operated Pascagoula Gas Plant onshore. The MMS paid transportation and processing rates comparable to other parties. However, the Destin portfolio showed revenue gains because MMS sold the Destin natural gas at premiums to the fair market value benchmarks. Like DIGS, MMS believes we achieved this premium because our Destin transportation contract provided the purchaser flexibility to resell the gas in the most advantageous market. Discovery Gas Transmission The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for nine meters (18 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 30,000 MMBtu/day on the Discovery Gathering and Transmission Pipelines beginning November 1, 2006. This pipeline transports natural gas production from the South Timbalier, Grand Isle, Ewing Bank, Green Canyon, and Mississippi Canyon areas offshore of Louisiana. The MMS receives the same average transportation rate as producers. The MMS also received a firm transportation rate to guarantee delivery from Discovery into the market with the highest net value. Processing takes place at the LaRose Gas Plant, where MMS received a processing rate equal to or better than the producers. The MMS converted this production to RIK due to the opportunity to move the gas to a market with a higher value, with revenue neutral transportation and processing costs. Sea Robin Gas Pipeline The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK status for fifteen meters

24

(22 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 27,800 MMBtu/day on the Sea Robin Gas Pipeline System starting November 1, 2006. Sea Robin transports natural gas from the East Cameron, Vermilion, South Marsh Island, and Eugene Island areas offshore of Louisiana to the Amerada Hess-owned Sea Robin Gas Plant and downstream markets. The MMS received transportation and processing rates equal to the producers, making this at least a revenue neutral portfolio. Tennessee (Grand Chenier) Gas Pipeline System The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK for twelve meters (33 leases/agreements) totaling approximately 11,700 MMBtu/day on the Tennessee Pipeline starting November 1, 2006. The production is from the East Cameron, West Cameron, and Vermilion areas of offshore Louisiana and it includes three leases from the Louisiana 8(g) zone. The Tennessee Gas Pipeline is a free-pooling pipeline, meaning there are no transportation charges. Gas was temporarily processed at Targa Resources' Lowry Gas Plant until the Grand Chenier Plant was rebuilt after damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The MMS expected this portfolio to be revenue neutral to possibly revenue positive depending on the processing rate received at the Grand Chenier Plant.

Onshore Natural Gas Conversions (see Section 4.2) Jonah Field (Opal) The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK from 41 lease/agreements totaling approximately 100,000 MMBtu/day from the Jonah field in Wyoming's Green River Basin beginning January 1,2007. The Jonah Gas Gathering System transports this gas south into the Williams' Opal Gas Plant, Enterprise's Pioneer Gas Plant, or into Anadarko's Rendezvous Gathering System. The MMS converted this production because RIK received a processing contract at the available natural gas plant that is expected to add significant value.
Pinedale Anticline The MMS converted natural gas royalties from RIV to RIK from six leases totaling approximately 20,000 MMBtu/day from the Pinedale field also in the Green River Basin of Wyoming beginning January 1,2007. The Questar Gas Management (QGM) gathering system transports the gas from the field south into the QGMoperated Black's Fork Gas Plant. The MMS converted this production because the RIK sales price could be higher than the non-arm's-Iength value reported by the producers.

Crude Oil Conversion-Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) (see Section 5.3) One property was converted from RIV to RIK status in the RIK Crude Oil Program during FY 2007. The MMS converted production from block Grand Isle 115, also known as the Gomez property, in order to increase the volumes provided to DOE for use in filling the SPR. The MMS receives no revenue for production transferred to the SPR Program.

25

(C) Revenues, Costs, and Savings Incurred by RIK
The quantitative benefits of the RIK Program include reduced administrative costs, a time value of money benefit from receiving payments earlier than RIV payments, and additional royalty revenue. During FY 2007, the benefits of the RIK Program totaled over $63 million.
Total Benefits of RIK Program? FY 2007 Crude Oil Natural Gas Administrative Savings Time Value of Money Benefit Revenue Performance Total Benefits $1,826,810 $2,306,589 $18,614,613 $22,748,012 $1,726,582 $782,483 $37,920,116 $40,429,181

Details of these benefits are presented in Section 3 of this report.

(D) Other Relevant Benefits or Detriments
Through the activities of the RIK Program, MMS staff has gained significant market knowledge regarding specific oil and natural gas markets. This knowledge is shared with other MMS offices, such as the Compliance and Asset Management to better MMS operations. The sharing of information between the RIK Program and other areas was an area of significant focus in FY 2007 and formal procedures for sharing information are now documented. Also, although not necessary in FY 2007, the RIK Program is in a unique position to provide data necessary in times of natural disasters, such as the hurricanes in 2005. The RIK Program answered special information requests from both the DOE and the Department of the Interior regarding Gulf of Mexico infrastructure after the 2005 hurricanes. The RIK Program stands ready to provide information whenever needed in future similar situations in order to support continuity of operations.

362609-mms2-pdf-62-135-135,"Also in 1998, MMS partnered with the Texas General Land Office (GLO) in another RIK project. This project involved natural gas production from Federal leases in the Texas 8(g) zone of the Gulf of Mexico. The 8(g) zone refers to the area within three miles seaward of state waters, where approximately 27 percent of lease revenues are shared with the coastal state. This pilot also had a goal to learn from the GLO's longstanding RIK Program. This project concluded the RIK strategy is viable for natural gas royalties and can lead to modest increases in revenue. It also resulted in administrative savings for MMS and industry, as in the Wyoming crude oil pilot. This pilot was later incorporated into a broad Gulf of Mexico pilot. In 1999, MMS and the General Services Administration (GSA) entered into an agreement to take natural gas in kind from Federal leases for use in GSA facilities. The pilot involved a series of exchange transactions and spanned from December 1999 through March 2001. This pilot demonstrated the need for MMS to seek authority to enter into and pay for transportation contracts in order to manage RIK volumes successfully. This authority was subsequently sought and granted by Congress in FY 2001. The MMS initiated sales under a Gulf of Mexico RIK Natural Gas Pilot in April 2000. This pilot involved the sale of approximately 500,000 MMBtu per day of RIK natural gas transported on nine pipeline systems in the Gulf of Mexico. This pilot allowed MMS to refine specific strategies and processes for selling RIK natural gas. Specific areas of focus included managing volumes, gas imbalances, and gas processing rights. The pilot provided an important base of market knowledge needed for the development of a defined business model for future RIK operations. The Gulf of Mexico RIK Crude Oil Pilot began in August 2000. It involved two competitive sales of RIK crude oil from Federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico of approximately 60,000 barrels per day. It provided MMS staff with important insights into crude oil markets, pipeline infrastructure, and competitive sales processes. In November 2001, the pilot ended to respond to a Presidential Directive to use RIK oil in filling the Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Although not a pilot project, the Small Refiner Program benefited from a number of improvements generated from the pilot programs. The MMS and its predecessor agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, have operated a Small Refiner Program for many years where RIK crude oil is sold to qualified small refiners. Transition from Pilot to Permanent Program The pilot projects advanced MMS's knowledge of the oil and gas markets and provided experience in using commercial approaches to sell production. The pilots provided MMS with an in-depth understanding of the implications of using the RIK approach. These implications included establishing a risk policy,

Energy Policy Act of 2005 Requirements The report covers the information required by Section 342 (e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct). The EPAct requires that for each of fiscal years 20062015 in which the United States takes oil or gas royalties in kind from production in any state or from the OCS, excluding royalties taken in kind and sold to refineries under subsection (h), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that describes:
(A) the one or more methodologies used by the Secretary to determine compliance with subsection (d), including the performance standard for comparing amounts received by the United States derived from royalties in kind to amounts likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value; (8) an explanation of the evaluation that led the Secretary to take royalties in kind from a lease or group of leases, including the expected revenue effect of taking royalties in kind; (C) actual amounts received by the United States derived from taking royalties in kind and costs and savings incurred by the United States associated with taking royalties in kind, including administrative costs savings and any new or increased administrative costs; and (0) an evaluation of other relevant public benefits or detriments associated with taking royalties in kind. This required information is contained within this report. Please see Section 6 for a summary of the information.

The Beginning of Royalty in Kind: Pilot Projects In 1998, MMS and the State of Wyoming collaborated on the first major RIK pilot project. The first competitive sale was for a 6-month term beginning in October 1998 involving only crude oil from Federal leases in the state. Subsequent sales included volumes of over 6,000 barrels per day and included production from state leases, as well. This pilot demonstrated that the RIK approach was viable, reduced the period of value uncertainty from years to months, increased royalty receipts, and yielded administrative savings to MMS and to industry. The Wyoming Crude Oil Program was discontinued in April 2006 due to low production volumes and changing market conditions.

Background

The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is the Federal agency that collects, accounts for, and disburses, on average, nearly $11 billion per year2 in revenues from Federal offshore mineral leases and from onshore mineral leases located on Federal and Indian lands. Historically, the recipients of these revenues include the U.S. Treasury, other Federal agencies, 38 states, 41 Indian tribes, and over 30,000 individual Indian mineral owners. Most of these revenues have historically been received in the form of cash payments, referred to as royalty in value (RIV) payments. Through the Royalty in Kind (RIK) Program, MMS takes Federal royalties in kind, in the form of product, and competitively sells the crude oil or natural gas on the open marketplace. The RIK Program improves government efficiencies, reduces administrative costs, and provides a fair market return on the public's royalty assets. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA), as amended, and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, authorize the collection of production royalties either in value or in kind for Federal lands leased for development on the outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and onshore. Further, the terms of almost all Federal oil and gas leases provide for royalties to be paid in value or in kind at the discretion of the lessor. In the mid-1990's, MMS began exploring the potential for a broadly applied RIK Program. Several pilot projects tested this approach under a variety of conditions for crude oil and natural gas, and for onshore and offshore production volumes. The MMS concluded that RIK is a viable approach to be used in tandem with royalty in value in managing Federal oil and gas royalty assets. The asset management strategy of MMS includes the selective and strategic use of both RIK and RIV, based on systematic economic analysis of the Federal oil and gas portfolio. The mission of the RIK Program is to: ""Develop and maintain the ability and expertise to fully utilize the RIK approach to efficiently manage and optimize the value of mineral royalty assets.""

362606-mms2-pdf-59-132-132,"In 2007, other packages of Gulf RIK gas, previously converted, continued to perform well based on lower costs realized for transportation and processing services and premiums paid over index prices. Overall revenue gains for the 22 Gulf natural gas packages in 2007 were over $24 million. In Wyoming, the two conversions were primarily based on (1) securing arrangements at local processing plants that lowered processing costs substantially below what current Federal lessees were incurring, or (2) obtaining sales prices that were substantially higher than what Federal lessees were receiving. FY 2007 revenue gains for Wyoming RIK gas were over $13 million.

RIK Crude Oil Program The RIK Crude Oil Program consists of three main SUb-programs: o The Unrestricted Program (Gulf of Mexico and Pacific), o The Small Refiner Program, and o The Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program (SPR).
In FY 2007, the Gulf Unrestricted Program realized revenue gains above FMV of more than $11 million, a substantial increase over the previous year. These gains are primarily attributable to: (1) RIK benefiting from crude oil price increases during FY 2007, because RIK crude oil sales contracts use ""calendar month"" pricing instead of earlier ""trade month"" pricing used in some industry sales contracts; and (2) RIK obtaining premiums from purchasers on certain crude packages for which the purchaser entered into lucrative downstream financial transactions and passed on a portion of those benefits to RIK. The MMS does not benefit financially from the SPR Program, but provides crude oil to the Department of Energy (DOE) for SPR fill to strengthen national security. In FY 2007, the RIK Program delivered over 4,300,000 barrels of crude oil to the DOE.

RIK Beyond FY 2007 The RIK Program continues to be a dynamic program. In FY 2008; RIK began transporting natural gas from Wyoming on the Rockies Express pipeline to the mid-continent and added substantial volumes to the onshore natural gas program to capture the rapidly increasing production in Wyoming. The current SPR fill initiative continued through the end of June 2008 and the crude oil barrels were converted to competitive sales in July 2008. The RIK Program has already implemented many, and will continue to implement, recommendations made by internal and external review groups, such as the Government Accountability Office, the Inspector General and the Royalty Policy Committee.

Appendix A

Executive Summary Overview The Fiscal Year 2007 Report to Congress fulfills this year's annual requirement under Section 342 (e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that the Secretary of the Interior submit to Congress a report that describes the performance, benefits, and savings associated with the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Royalty in Kind (RIK) Program. This report also serves as the annual update for other program stakeholders, detailing the history, current status, operational condition, and the successes of the MMS RIK Program over the past year and longer term.
Through the RIK Program, MMS takes royalties on crude oil and natural gas production in amount or ""in kind"" from the Federal lessee rather than via a cash payment, or ""in value"" method. The MMS then sells that crude oil or natural gas production competitively on the open market. Through the competitive sales process, the RI K Program increases the return on the American taxpayers' crude oil and natural gas royalty assets. The RIK Program accomplishes this by: (1) improving government efficiencies, (2) reducing administrative costs, and (3) providing a fair market return on the royalty assets of the American taxpayers, typically reflected in increased revenues over the in value method. Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 marks the 10-year anniversary of the first formal evaluation of the RIK concept. A number of pilot projects and other studies confirmed the benefits of an RIK strategy used in tandem with the traditional royalty in value (RIV) approach. During FY 2007, there were many significant changes in the RIK Program. The joint MMS-Department of Energy Program to fill the remaining capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) began in July 2007. In the RIK Natural Gas Program, seven new sales packages were added, significantly increasing the natural gas volumes in RIK. Two of these packages involve production from onshore Federal leases in the State of Wyoming under a new partnership that began in FY 2006. The RIK Program provides several economic benefits for the American public: (1) Lower administrative costs - The program reduces administrative costs by reducing the number of costly reviews, audits, and disputes over payment. (2) Time value of money - Additional benefits accrue to the government due to earlier receipt of royalty payments under the RIK Program, because RIK sales contracts require earlier payments than in value royalties. (3) Increased revenue - The government receives increased royalty receipts by obtaining higher sales values for RIK production and by paying lower operational costs for transporting and processing RIK production.

During FY 2007, the benefits of the RIK Program totaled over $63 million.

Background The RIK Program began as a pilot program in 1998 in partnership with the State of Wyoming involving crude oil. Also that year, MMS collaborated with the Texas General Land Office to sell natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. The program quickly expanded after that to include sales to government facilities through the General Services Administration in 1999 and broader sales of crude oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico in 2000. The program transitioned into a permanent program with the approval and publication of the Five Year Royalty in Kind Business Plan in 2004, following an independent review and analysis verifying the program's viability by the Lukens Energy Group. RIK Business Model and Organization The RIK business model was designed according to statutory authorities as a conservative, price-taker seller of energy commodities into the wholesale, upstream market. However, the model also incorporated many commercial oil and gas practices, such as use of standard industry oil and gas contracts, sales terms , and competitively based transportation and processing contracts. The organizational structure also followed typical industry design, incorporating: (1) Front Offices for management of the royalty asset, including conversion of properties to RIK, supporting the Procurement Branch in securing transportation and processing contracts, and conducting sales; (2) a Mid Office for counterparty pre-qualification and credit analysis; and (3) a Back Office to manage invoices and production imbalances. Additionally, MMS has incorporated an Economic Analysis Office within the RIK structure to compute and analyze revenue performance measurements and assist in economic analyses of oil and gas markets. Five Year Business Plan Goals The Five Year Plan set out a number of measurable commercial objectives and efficiency goals for the RIK Program, several of which were modified to reflect the unanticipated financial success of the program, production declines, and royalty relief litigation.

Small discrepancies in the totals in tables in this report are due to rounding .

Two of the primary objectives are to: o Realize maximum benefits by optimizing RIK volumes: o RIK Natural Gas - initial goal to grow to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day in FY 2009 (revised to 825,000 thousand cubic feet per day), o RIK Crude Oil - maintain static volumes of up to 190,000 barrels per day through FY 2009, o Enhance net revenue by an initial goal of $50 million over 5 years, (revised to $125 million). The RIK Program has made significant progress towards achieving these goals and other goals outlined in the Five Year Plan and is currently developing a subsequent multi-year plan to carry the program beyond 2009. FY 2007 Process Improvements During FY 2007, MMS implemented many improvements to processes and policies within the RIK Program. These improvements include: o Specific procedures about bid acceptance during RIK sales, o Clearly defined roles and responsibilities during the RIK sale process, o Specific documentation requirements regarding the decision making process during RIK sales and improved record keeping, o Strengthened internal controls in all of the RIK processes, o Coordination with the MMS Procurement Office, and o Procedures for information sharing and volume reconciliations between the RIK Program and the MMS Compliance and Asset Management Program. Revenue Performance RIK revenue performance measures the financial success and economic benefits of the RIK Program by comparing RIK sales receipts to a fair market value (FMV) benchmark range. The FMV methodology was devised in collaboration with an independent energy consulting firm, Lukens Energy Group. The FMV benchmark is an approximation of what the average third-party may have sold the same production for and estimates what MMS would expect to see on average through RIV. Following are the revenue performance results in FY 2007 for RIK natural gas sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Wyoming, RIK crude oil sales in the Gulf, and the Small Refiner Program. RIK Natural Gas Program In FY 2007, the MMS converted seven new packages of natural gas from RIV status to RIK. Conversion is based on MMS' statutory obligation under the Energy Policy Act to assure that RIK benefits would equal or exceed those received under the RIV method of royalty collection. Five of the seven packages (all in the Gulf of Mexico) were converted as ""revenue neutral,"" primarily to increase volumes in concert with the Five Year Plan. However, in several of the Gulf conversions, MMS identified an opportunity to obtain bids with premium, above index prices, because purchasers could benefit from access to attractive downstream markets using RIK transportation contracts.

Re: Request for competitive marine minerals lease sale withi.'i--ithe EEZ of the Territory of Guam

I would like to request a competitive marine minerals lease sale, within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Guam, under U.S . Code 30 C.F.R. 281. We are making the request through our US subsidiary, Nautilus Minerals USA Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada (copy of Articles of attached). Given the unusual nature of the application, and the large area applied for, we are proposing that the Department grant the applications by waiving the normal pegging requirement for leases (as the ?ea being applied for would equate to in-excess of 1.2 million standard 1300x300 feet claim blocks).

In your letter you enclosed a check for $US 13 5, which you stated comprised a $US 10 filing fee, $US25 location fee,and $US 100 first annual maintenance fee made payable to the Department of the Interior. As the Associate Director for the Minerals Management Service's Offshore Minerals Management Program, I have been asked to respond to your request and to return the original check, which has been voided. I am informed of your recent discussions and materials related to the proposed project in Guam. I am also apprised of the August 7,2006, discussions with the Leasing Division of the MMS and the maps and background materials you have supplied related to?the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In the March 12,2007, letter in response to your proposal related to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, I informed you that MMS is impeded by having no clear authority to review requests for mineral leases within the United States EEZ that are not adjacent to its 50 states. Consistent with the March 12, 2007, letter, the MMS is working with our legal advisors on long-range efforts to clarify the regulatory authority for future action on EEZ matters. I appreciate your interest in the exploration of the Pacific EEZ and your sharing information about the area with this Agency.

Active hydrothermal sites have been sampled on three volcanoes in the Mariana Arc. Results are inbiguing, because they infer that arc vent fields may be the best modem analogues of ore deposits currently mined on land, partfcularly the gold-rich variety.
Proposed Tenement Area

Neptune is interested in exploring an area that covers the SM8-prospective areas defined and described in previous research previous research expeditions, specifically the NOAA 2003, 2004 and 2006 Ring of Fire expeditions. Using the exploration model applied to Neptune's granted New Zealand tenement, the work program would entail defining the tonnage and grade of SMS areas previously defined and definition of further areas by geophysical techniques.

A proposed area for exploration would comprise the chain of seamounts comprising the
Mariana Arc and features in the back arc located to the west of the arc. The areas of interest are within the boundaries of the CNMI EEl.

The total area of tenement applications is approximately 8,000 square miles. The precise area would be more closely defined on a large-scale bathymetric chart.
Secretary Kempthome, Neptune Minerals would be grateful for any assistance that you could give to the MMS in enabling a fusion of the current license granting function with an associated license administration functionality.

If there is any further information you require of Neptune Minerals in respect of this request. I would be delighted to comply.
I remain sir,
Yours sincerely

Stable and transparent system government wrth pragmatic approach to development

Neptune seeks to: o o o o o o o Cooperate with US and CNMI Governments, US and intemational researchers to guide the speed and focus of research and exploration into SMS deposits. Undertake meaningful commercial exploration, leading to definition and appraisal of
SMS deposits.

Investigate alternative mechanisms and techniques of extraction and exploitation of
SMS deposits.

Attract larger joint venturer to take equity share in the capital-intensive development and . ommercialisation phases of the project. c Create a consortium to economically mine SMS deposits and mar1<et the product Mining SMS deposits is inevitable and will happen one day Every single aspect of what is requ1red for seafloor mining is being used somewhere at present. primarily technologies for the oil and gas Industry.

Core Beliefs:

o
o
o

1t is the combination of technologies for minerals that is NEW.
Main hurdle is the conservatism of mineral companies to go offshore (currently mining diamonds to 200-600m, oil development to 3000m water depth is common).
The high risk and high reward scenario will be a viable way to win hlgh""ijrade polymetallic deposits for many years.

ProJeet Risk

Neptune recognises the unconventional nature of the Mariana SMS project. and that it represents a genuine frontier exploration situation. It is both a high-cost and high-risk scenario but one where the rewards of success are commensurably high. High-grade mineralisation has been demonstrated within the area of interest and the main project risk remains the definition of economic ore. Neptune's devetoprnent plan is to use available data and research expertise to assess? the current known targets to determine the most economically Viable and to seek a partner that will lead the development and production phase.
The Mariana Arc

Among the most volcanically active - and the only submarine volcanic arc in waters under U.S. juriscUction - is the Mariana Arc. The Mariana Arc region features some 40 submarine volcanic edifices in addition to 11 major subaerial volcanoes along more than 1 ,000 km of arc length. Volcanic activity in the Mariana Arc is frequent and widespread. Most of the known activity from submarine volcanoes comes from the shallowest peaks, where eruptions and hydrothermal discharge produce observable changes In the surface waters. Unseen and unexplored, however, Is hydrothermal and volcanic activity on the majority of the submarine volcanoes, where summit depths exceed 300 m.

Re: Proposal for Seafloor Exploration licence eNMI Exclusive Economic Zone

I am writing to you to request that opportunities for leasing minerals be made available to Neptune Minerals Pic on seafloor areas within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the CommonweaJth of the Northem Mariana Islands (CNMI).
In infonnal discussions with various staff of the Minerals Management Service, we have been told that the authority to lease mineral resources in the EEZ is not clearly vested in any agency of the U.S. Government. However, given the Department of the Interior's (DOl) stewardship responsibirrties for mineral and energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf, 001 seems to be the most appropriate agency with which to begin our efforts to obtain these leases.

Overview
Neptune Minerals Marianas Pic (Neptune) wishes to apply for mineral leases within the EEl of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mona Islands. The Neptune Group was initially established in 1999 to apply for seafloor mineral targets within New Zealand's 200 nautlcal-mlle EEZ. The applications were to investigate and commercialise the hydrothermal seafloor massive sulphide (SMS) deposits identified by researchefs at IGNS and NrNA and International researchers. . Neptune has three granted Prospeding Licenses in the New Zealand EEZ, which give the company exclusive commercial exploration access to those areas. International research organisations continue to have free and unhindered access to the areas. Neptune seeks to add to its portfolio of SMS prospective acreage. The Company is keen to advance the exploration and development of mineralised SMS deposits that are located along the Mariana Arc. CNMI represents a desirable area for Neptune's expansion, fulfilling the following pal'8meters:

Mr. Simon McDonald Managing Director, :MPESA Neptune Minerals Camden Villa, 56 Alfred Street Milsons Point Sydney NSW 2061 AUSTRALIA

Dear Mr. McDonald: Thank you for your letter dated September 22, 2006, to Secretary Dirk Keinpthome regarding Neptune Minerals' interests in for leasing minerals on seafloor areas within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMl). AE the Acting Associate Director for the Minerals Management Service's (MMS) Offshore Minerals Management Program, I have. been asked to respond.

I am informed of your discussions with the MM:S's Leasing Division. I note that the project your company proposes is on the frontier of geographic areas researched to date, and on the frontier of mechanisms and techniques to explore potential mineral deposits.
As you stated in your letter, the Department of the Interior has stewardship responsibilities for Outer Continental Shelf mineral resources. However, as I understand, you have been informed by MMS officials, no clear authority exists for me to direct the MMS to review an application for

leasing activity within the United States EEZ that are not adjacent to States. Consequently, at this time, the MM:S does not have any regulatory authority to act upon your request. Thank you for providing us with your proposal. !fyou have any questions or would like to schedule a meeting regarding the issues you have addressed with 1lS, please call Renee Orr, Chief, Leasing Division at (703) 787?1215. Sincerely,
--:;7 o

NORTHERN MARIANAS (22 0 to 14?N)
Style: Intra-Oceanic Arc and back-arc basin Hydrothermal Vtnt Prospectivity: High Gold-beaTing SMS Prospectivity: Possibly Mod-high? General Commenu: o Hydrothermal vents occur on seamounts of the main volcanic arc chain and also to the west within the spreading centre and back-arc basin trough. o The arc and trough extend to the south into the Guam EEZ. o Recent data was acquired from NOAA '5 Rim of Fire cruises in 2003, 04. 06. o Many sites were dived during the NOAA 2006 cruise. o Addition data was collected by Japanese cruises o The hydrothennal vents within the Marianas EEl contain occurrences of polymetallic sulphides with high In-Pb results and moderate Au (up to 1.7 ppm Au). o Marianas hydrothennal arc system occurs between 100- 1600 m water depth. The back-arc trough site (Alice Springs) is 3600 m depth. Reported Hydrothermal Vent Sites with known locations (6 from [SA & JS Additional Databases) o PMS - Alice Springs, or 180N Alice Springs, or Central Mariana Trough (assays). o LTH - Kasuga Seamount, NW Eifuku (Champagne vent), Esmeralda Bank o NFS - Mariana Back-Arc Basin, West Mariana Ridge Reported Hydrolhermallndic:ators with approximate locations (NOAA 2003-06 maps): o Kasuga 2. NW Eifuku, Daikoku, Ahyi, Maug, lealandia Bank, East Diamanle, Esmeralda NW Rota 1. W Rota. o Another hydrothennal site nonh of EEl in Pacific Rim EEl - Nikko. Comments on Known Fields: o Alice Springs - (also known as Central Mariana). Depth is around 3600 m. This appears to be the first hydrothennal site found in this region by the USA Alvin Cruise in 1987, and is located in the back-arc basin area west of the main arc. Japanese crews revisited the area in 1992 and undertook 5 dives to collect data. Active hydrothennal vents/eruptions were observed, up to 287 deg C, and sulphides observed (Garno et al. 1992). Eleven samples taken at this site \\ith anomalous metals (see below). o Kasuga 2 (200 m) - Weak hydrothennal plumes noted. o NW Rota (700 m depth) - showed sulphur and ejecta discharging from vent. Brimstone pit (550 m) also showing hydrothermal discharging. o East Diamante (-300 m depth) - contains nwnerous tall sulphide-sulphate chimneys. Vents at 350 m at 240 deg C (boiling point at 300 m). Mounds and chimneys composed of pyrite, sphalerite: chalcopyrite, barite, and anhydrite. The known field of sulphide chimneys is named ""Black Forest"" discovered at a depth of about 345 m on one of the central cones. Very interesting area but no samples/assays found. o NW Eifuku (1550 m depth) - discharging liquid C02 from focused- and diffuseflow vents. This vent site consist of small chimneys and mounds up to a meIer

high that are composed of sulphur and one or more unknown minerals. but no sulphides noted. Maug - Maug is a shallow caldera with a central cone that rises to a depth of -30 m. The only definitive hydrothermal signal was on the N E flank of the cone at which low-temperature discharge was discovered Daikoku - Weak hydrothennal plumes noted.

Known Rock Types: o NOAA cruise logs notes largely basaltic and andesitic volcanoes with some variability in magma chemistry from site to site. Some dacite also occurs in places. Magma degassing is common, causing sulphur plumes at several hydrothermal vent sites. Rock types include massive lavas and associated breccias (e.g. hyaloclastite) and other volcaniclastic rocks. Some lava samples contain minor microdiorite xenoliths. Known Melal Grades.' o Eleven samples were taken from the Central Mariana Trough or Alice Springs site in the back-arc area at 3600 m depth. These rocks contain high linc (up to 38.9 wt%) and high Lead (up to 12.5 wt%), Gold (up to 1.7 ppm). Cadmium (up to 1802 ppm), Copper (up to 2.51 wt%), Barium (up to 45.2 wt%) and S (up to 21 ,,*1%). See GSC ISA database, Hannington (1989) and Ishibashi and Urabe (1995). No known samples are known from the shal10wer arc chimneys (East Diamante).

Nautilus Minerals is exploring for high grade gold, silver, copper, and zinc rich submarine massive sulphide deposits (SMS) within the TerTilorial Waters of the sovereign state of Papua New Guinea. Work to date has shown that these systems contain spectacular high metal grades, To date a total of 88 surface sulphide grab sampJes have been collected ITom Nautilus' Solwan J prospect within EL 1196 in the Manus Basin, returning averagt cnda or 15.5 gil gold, 1919/f silver, IO.8-t. copper, and 4.7""1. Zn. Drilling by partner Placer Dome Oceania in January/Febroll)' 2006 conftrmed the presence of this high grade system, with sulphide intersections up to 19m below the sea floor, with a best intersection of 11.6m at 9.1 gil Au and H .J%Cu. Barkeround: Black smokers, the ""surface"" expression of active SMS systems, were discovered by researchers in 1977 in the Galapagos Rift. Since this tirst discovery upwards of 200 active vent sites have been discovered over the past 30 years. nearly all by government funded researchers. The hydrothermal vents fonn in areas of high geothermal gradients, commonly at active plate margins, and are nonnally associated with submarine voJc:anoes and/or volcanic activity. In these settings, high temperature (>400 0c) metalrich fluids mi.""( with cold sea water. depositing metals, and sustaining vent ecosystems dependent on the oxidation of the vented hydrogen sulphide (H1S).

Scientists quickly recognized lhat the geological sening in PNG was favorable for tile development of these deposits, and a series of cruises by Marine Scientific Researchers (MSR's) throughout the 1990's soon established the presence of a number of very high grade systems within the Manus and Woodlarlc: basins.

programs in early 2005. This work successfully identified it number of high grade targets. with 39 surface sulphide samples retuming average grades of 15.5 gil Au, 256 gil Ag, 12.240/, 4.2% Zn and 1.8% Ph. The Solwara I target In lhe Suzette hydrothennal field was selected on the basis of this work for subsequent driJIing and cutting tests.

Elplorltion The PNG government granted EL 1196 to Nautilus Minerals in 1997. This was the first exploralion perm it in the world to allow exploration for SMS systems, and put PNG at the forefront of an exciting new era for exploration.

The friable nature of the ground presented difficulties for the ship based drilling operations. with core recoveries only averaging 47%. Results have however continued to confirm the high grade natun: of the systems. and indicated sulphide accumulations up to 19m in the mound/rubble zones below the very high grade

Nautilus is working with its aUiance putners Perry Slingsby Systems and Canyon Offshore to develop a drilling platform lhat will handle the difficult drill conditions experienced in the 2006 drilling program. The system en\'isages the marinisation of a proven quality land based drill system. and anaching this to a large ROV. with drill operations managed via a protected fiber optic cable back to the ""mother ship"", The resulting driJI unit should have improved mobility, and significantly improved control ""at the bit face"", resulting in markedly improved core recoveries.

Collaboration is a key element of the exploration component of Nautilus' business model, with the company estimating Marine Scientific Researchers have spent in-excess of SCAN40 million dollan on exploratory cruises within PNG's territorial waters. MSR work has identified numerous high grade massive sulphide deposits, and significantly the exploration risk for Nautilus, as it focuses its initial work on high grade systems already defined, essentially removing the risk of grassroots exploration.

Scenario planning at present envisages that mining will likely concentnte on largely inactive mounds, with surface temperatures at or below those currently being experienced in some terrestrial operations in PNG (eg Lihir Island, where temperarures are locally >250oq .
The mined product hoisted to surface wiU likely be barged to an onshore processing facility, and the small quantity of tailings produced will be stored in a permined storage facility. Nautilus recently signed a Heads or Agreement with Belgium based Jan De Nul. one of the world's leading international dredging companies. Under the agreement. Jan De Nul will construct at its cost, a specialized deep sea mining vessel for Nautilus's Solwara Project in PNG. The J91 meIer long vessel (the ""Jules Verne"") is expecled to be completed in 2009 to meet Nautilus'S targeted. subject to PNG Government approval. end of 2009 date 10 commence mining operations.

Nautilus commissioned Worely Parson Engineering to complete a study 10 review the feasibility of matching the appropriate land based mining technology with lechnology used in the offshore oil and gas industry. The results of this study indicated that the business model was feasible. and the economics competitive with land based mining operations.
The overall mining concept envisaged; I. a seafloor mining/extraction system with malerials handling into, 2. a hoisting system (air lift or pumping through a flexible riser). and 3. surface recovery and short lerm storage.

A key element of the business plan is the ""transportable"" nature of the capital, another unique element of the deep sea mining model. One of the biggest hurdles for terrestrial mines to overcome is the need to employ and amortize large amounts of capital, much of which can only be utilized on a single deposit. The Nautilus business model sees the modest capital estimated in the original Worely study being ""recycled"" and reused on multiple deposits, lowering the individual deposit targer size, and significantly increasing the likelihood of discoveries becoming economic. and extracted.

Dialogue with PNG government officials, many respected researc:hen, concerned stakeholden, and other mining industry professionals. has to date revealed a high level of interest in the project. and a general desire 10 help ensure impacts are minimized. and benefits realized. Most researchers agree that ""there is no imminent threot to the entire global vent fauna from mining (Juniper 1000/) n. No different 10 land, the challenge for the industry, working closely with the regulators, is to develop a mining stntegy thal maintains biodiversity throughout the process or extraction, and shows sound rehabilitation projections.
The Alliance

The Future
Nautilus has mapped out a challenging plan to mOVe the project into production by the end of 2009. The plan involves the continued use of recognized world experts in engineering. environment, and material processing and handling. Many of these and the skill sets thaI the company requires reside outside PNG at present, whoever it is Nautilus' goal 10 train and localize as many positions as possible as PNG slowly becomes the word leader in this
new industry.

Nautilus Minerals has fonned a unique lechnical alliance with it group of major international companies from within Ihe offshore equipment.

The company expects to continue to forge strong relationships and alliances with members of the Marine Scientific Research community, and the PNGgovemment and regulalors ,

Draft Murkoski trip agenda 9-2 ...

Thank you Karen. Yes, the attached updated itinerary reflects this schedule, dropping the Senator and you in Port Fourchon at the end of the offshore flight, around 5:00 pm. We are hoping to rearrange schedules so that Liz Birnbaum and Sarah Bittleman (Secretary's Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs) will join you and the Senator for the offshore trip. Will the Senator and you be involved in a tour of Port Fourchon Saturday evening? If yes, would the Senator be interested in having Liz and Sarah join you for that tour? I will be sending you information forms for both you and the Senator to fill out. The forms ask for personal information such as weight and shoe size; this information is needed for planning the helicopter flight and issuance of safety steel toed shoes for the tour of the offshore facility. Also, keep in mind that clothing worn for the offshore trip should be natural fiber shirts and pants, such as cotton shirts, jeans or khaki pants. There are changing room facilities at the Atlantic Aviation helicopter base. Lyn Herdt, Chief MMS Office of Congressional Affa irs 202 208-3502 (Office) 202208-3828 (Direct Line) 202258-1702 (Cell)

Hey there, Lyn and I spoke with Karen this evening and she is going to try and move the Senator's speech to 9 a.m. (she needs to talk to Landrieu's office about it) and then we can maybe do the offshore trip around 10 or 10:30 depending on how long she is going to speak. So we could potentially keep the schedule based on what I sent you, just moving all the times ahead a few hours.

Lesley I'm not ignoring this, just still trying to get a verdict. Thanks for the help and patience.

From: Haenny, Lesley [mailto:Lesley.Haenny@mms.gov] Sent: Tuesday, September 08,20093:43 PM To: Simpson, Kevin (Energy) Subject: Murkowski Propsed Trip

Kevin, I've attached a suggested itinerary from our Gulf office for what Senator Murkowski could expect from her brief trip to the Gulf region. Again, our Gulf office strongly suggests that this trip takes place in the early morning, as this time of year severe thunderstorms build up in the afternoon in the area. MMS has an excellent safety record, and the contracted helicopter pilots will not fly in bad weather. Because weather conditions can be unpredictable in the Gulf, a likely scenario that could happen is that the weather in the morning is perfect and by the time you get to one of the offshore platforms, a severe storm has moved into the area. In cases like this, the helicopter pilots will not fly off the platform until weather improves, so there is a chance that the Senator and COS could be stuck on a platform until the weather clears up. Please call me with any questions, concerns or updates you have regarding this trip. I look forward to hearing

One thing I do know is that the 1pm to 5pm timeframe has some wiggle room, but Sen . Murkowski is not going to be able to do an entire full day trip this time. I suppose she will have to visit either the production rig or the floating rig but not both - and my guess is that she'll choose the production rig although I'm not sure.

Hi Kevin, Happy Friday! Hope you are doing well and that you have a fun weekend planned. (C)

I was wondering if you had anymore info on Senator Murkowski's potential offshore trip? I have spoken with our New Orleans office, the office that would handle the trip and they gave me some details that I wanted to pass along to you.
They would like to take the Senator to two different platforms, a production facility (drilling rig) and then a floating facility (this will take pretty much the entire day). They will try and find two that are close together to minimize time flying in the helicopter. While the helicopter may not be able to drop her off at Port Fourchon, our MMS staff will get her to Port Fourchon after the trip. That will not be a problem. I should know by next week whether or not the helicopter can drop her off there. Normally, a full offshore trip will take two days, and they always leave a day open for weather related issues. There will be some approval forms that will need to be filled out and sent back to me right away once this is
4

completely planned (which I can send to you if you want) . I was also asked what the Senator will be dOing while she is in Port Fourchon? Depending on what she will be doing, if she has any meetings, MMS works with many local and state entities in that area and could do a combined presentation for her while she is there. Do you have the dates confirmed yet? I know you originally told me the 25 th and 26 th , and I didn't realize until later that the 26 th was a Saturday. We can still do this if it's on Saturday, but I'm told there is much less staff around that day (on the rigs as well) . Let's touch base either today or sometime next week if you can. Thanks so much, I look forward to hearing from you! Thanks ,

Hi Stratton, Thanks for your email! The WSJ article is focused on the lack of insurance of operator's to cover the repair of their facilities, which is not the same issue as MMS's bonding requirements. MMS is not involved in how a company insures their capitol assets. However, to protect the Federal government, the MMS does require lessee to obtain bonds at various level of coverage at the difference stages of a lease. A $50 thousand lease bond or $300 thousand area-wide (Le., region) bond is required before a lease is issued, when there is no activity in the area. This basically covers back rents and/or royalties due and civil penalties (if any) but could be used for any administrative cost associated with the lease or obligation of the lessee for leases with no activity. Once exploratory plans are submitted, a higher level of bonding is required ($200K per lease or $1 million for the area) and then yet a higher threshold once development plans are submitted ($500K per lease or $3 million per area). Once a lease has accrued decommissioning obligations (wells or platform) a supplemental bond is required if the cost to decommission exceeds the bonding already in place (usually does). The amount of the supplemental bond is set according to the MMS estimated cost to perform decommissioning and varies from lease to lease depending on the amount of obligations. The link below provides information on MMS's bonding requirements for the OCS. It has links to both the CFR citation covering financial assurance and two Notice to Lessees that provide guidance on general and supplemental bonds. http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/lsesale/surety.html Again, please feel free to email Lyn and I if you have any further questions.

By TOM BENNING

Many energy companies are facing the late-blooming Gulf Coast hurricane season without insurance against storm damage to their offshore platforms, pipelines and drilling rigs. Although the annual storm season has been mild so far, the first hurricane, Bill, brewed up in the Atlantic last weekend, and federal forecasters are predicting three to six hurricanes this year, one or two of which will probably qualify as major. Consumers are less likely than in earlier years to see spiking prices if hurricanes hit, experts said, because big stockpiles of oil, natural gas and gasoline have built up in the U.S. since the recession began . But for small and midsize energy companies, a storm's impact could be serious, because they would have to pay for repairs out of their own pockets at a time when revenues have been shrinking because of the global slump in oil and natural-gas prices . ""The offshore sector is a lot more exposed than people realize,"" said Howard Mills, director of Deloitte LLP's insurance industry group . Rate increases of as much as 60% kept many energy companies from buying as much insurance as in years past, brokers said.

And even companies willing to pay higher prices couldn't always do so. Insurers slashed the $5 billion of primary coverage they had offered last year by as much as 40%, brokers said , because of losses after two 2008 storms, Gustav and Ike. Over the past five years, Gulf Coast insurance on offshore energy assets produced about $4 billion in premiums and $12 billion in claims, said Bertil Olsson, director of insurance broker Marsh's U.S. energy practice. Many energy companies acknowledge that they have bought less insurance this year, or moved completely to selfinsurance. But they say improved technology and increased regulations make damage less likely and insurance less necessary. That is the view at Rowan Companies Inc., which operates nine drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, said spokeswoman Suzanne McLeod. The company dropped windstorm coverage this year on some of its smaller, older rigs, she said. Its insurance coverage ""may be inadequate,"" the company acknowledged in its most recent quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., which operates 11 drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, and Devon EnergyCorp., which owns several platforms and rigs, both chose to go without wind coverage this year, according to SEC filings. The two companies were among those saying that they need less hurricane insurance because they now use more durable structures and stronger mooring lines. Companies also employ more advanced global positioning systems, so they can more easily move rigs out of harm's way. And if a rig breaks loose, they can find and retrieve it quickly, limiting the damage it would receive or cause by crashing into something. Only 15% of moored drilling rigs went adrift in last year's hurricanes, compared with 63% during hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, according to the federal Minerals Management Service. TransOcean Ltd ., which operates 12 drilling rigs in the Gulf, shifted almost completely to windstorm self-insurance after Hurricane Katrina, said spokesman Guy Cantwell. The company uses deepwater rigs and platforms that aren't as susceptible to hurricane damage, he said . But analysts are concerned about some companies' decisions to drop or reduce their insurance coverage. Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., a Houston-based energy investment bank, recently issued a research note pointing out that Williams Partners LP and DCP Midstream Partners LP dropped windstorm coverage on their jOintly owned Discovery pipeline. The note,entitled ""Riskier Business,"" said the companies' insurance costs have more than doubled since last year, ""so can't really fault them"" for going without. But the analysts advised investors to ""keep eyes peeled if/when storm rolls through the gulf."" Both companies declined to comment. The Gulf Coast accounts for about a quarter of U.S. domestic oil output and about 11 % of domestic natural-gas production , according to the federal Energy Information Administration . In the past, prolonged delays in resuming energy production there reduced supplies and drove up prices . In 2005, when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused shutdowns that constricted the supply of natural gas, gas prices soared to all-time high above $15 per million British thermal units. This year, global stockpiles of oil and natural gas remain high, and analysts said the global slump in oil and natural-gas demand because of the recession could cushion the effect of a hurricane and keep prices low. ""There is greater tolerance in the system to take on a major storm,"" said Michael Wojciechowski, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm .

oes Oil and Gas Leasing Program Development

Section 18 of the OCS Lands Act explicitly details the decision-making process governing development of a 5-Year Leasing Program, which indicates the size, timing, and location of oil and gas lease sales on the OCS for a 5-year period. The Act directs the Secretary to follow a series of steps, each requiring public notice in the Federal Register, solicitation of comments thereon from affected or interested parties, and response to those comments. All comments are read and tallied by commenter category (e.g. public interest organization, State government, individual citizen). Comment summaries are published as an Appendix to the subsequent program document and comments on a particular OCS area are included in the options section of the document. Particular attention is paid to comments from Governors of affected States and interested Federal agencies as required by the Act. Following the initial step, the Request for Information (RFI), there are three subsequent decision points to narrow the areas of consideration-Draft Proposed Program (DPP), Proposed Program (PP), and Proposed Final Program (PFP). On average, the program preparation process takes from 18 to 24 months from pUblication of the RFI, the first notice to the public that the program preparation process is starting, to approval of a final program. Attached is a timing chart of the major steps in the preparation of the current 5-year program for 2007-2012. At each of these steps, the Secretary is required to develop and analyze proposals setting forth a schedule oflease sales for the five-year period using the factors set out in section 18(1) Existing information on the geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics of such regions; (2) Equitable sharing of developmental benefits and environmental risks among the various regions; (3) Location of such regions and regional and national energy markets; (4) Location with respect to other current and anticipated uses of the sea and seabed; (5) Expressed industry interest; (6) Laws, goals, and policies of affected States specifically identified by Governors; (7) Relative environmental sensitivity and marine productivity of different areas of the OCS; and (8) Environmental and predictive information for different areas of the OCS. At each successive step, the Secretary may remove areas from leasing consideration, but may not add areas back in. While not addressing the 5-year process or ""winnowing"" in particular, the Supreme Court in Secretary o/the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312 (1984), addressed the phased nature of the OCSLA process after passage of the 1978 amendments from the 5-year stage through to development and production. The Circuit Court in California v. Watt, 712 F2d 584 (DC Cir 1983) described a winnowing

sequence that the ""process is pyramidic in structure, proceeding from broad-based planning to an increasingly narrower focus as actual development grows more imminent. .."" Therefore, after consideration ofthe comments received in response to the RFI, MMS develops the analyses for the DPP, which consider the full acreage of all 26 planning areas and do not presume a decision as to size, timing, and location of likely lease sales. MMS regional offices and headquarters divisions gather/develop the data for the analyses from Bureau-sponsored environmental and geological studies, industry submissions, internal computer models, and other sources. The analyses include planning area rankings by several of the section 18 factors and include estimates of o o o o o unleased, undiscovered, economically recoverable resources, the Net Economic Value of planning area resources, the Net Social Value of producing planning area resources (Net Economic Value, less Net Environmental and Social Costs), Relative Environmental Sensitivity, and Marine Productivity (which at times has been incorporated into Relative Environmental Sensitivity).

The analyses are sent forward for the DPP decision, along with the comment summaries and decision options and recommendations. The DPP decision is the first of three Secretarial program decisions in the winnowing process and serves as the basis for the next round of analyses. The decision and supporting analyses are sent to State Governors and published for public review; a minimum 60-day comment is mandated under the Act. MMS analyzes the same section 18 factors for the PP but considers only the new ""program areas,"" those planning areas or portions thereof that the Secretary has selected for future consideration in the 5-year process. The PP decision is published along with the draft environmental impact statement (EIS) (see paragraph below) followed by a mandated minimum 90-day comment period, summary of comments, analyses, and the PFP decision, which is the final Secretarial decision in the process. The PFP decision documents are sent to the President and Congress and published along with the final EIS . The Secretary may approve a new program no sooner than 60 days after submittal to the President and Congress.

In addition, a programmatic EIS is prepared as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are solicited on scoping for preparation of the draft EIS. Public hearings are held during the comment period for the draft EIS in various coastal locations around the Nation. The analysis and consideration of alternatives in the EIS provide critical information for the decision maker in conjunction with the analysis and comments pursuant to section 18. The EIS preparation schedule is aligned with the section 18 process such that the Secretary receives the draft EIS concurrently with the PP analyses and the final EIS concurrently with the PFP analyses.
The Act ultimately requires that the Secretary set forth a program whose timing and location of leasing, to the maximum extent practicable, obtains a proper balance

between the potentials for environmental damage, the discovery of oil and gas, and adverse impact on the coastal zone, using cost-benefit analysis. The court has stated that this balancing does not require that the three factors be weighted equally but that the Secretary look at all the factors then balance the results. ""The Act does not mandate any particular balance, but vests the Secretary with discretion to weigh the elements so as to 'best meet national energy needs.'"" [California v. Watt I, (1981)].

Jamie, Herb has provided me with the specific information you were requesting. Apache's SP 62 A & B structures were destroyed by hurricane Katrina. They are about 8500' apart. MMS approved of the reefing proposal for SP 62 B structure and suggested that Apache work with MS Dept of Marine Resources to reef the A structure in the SP 62 B reef site. When a State requests an artificial reef permit from the Corps, it requests an area large enough to add additional material in the future, but not so large that the Coast Guard would require expensive monitoring. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Coast Guard requires an expensive lighted ""smart buoy"" for sites larger than Y:z mile radius . So the States' artificial reef sites are typically 4000' squares . This allows them to place a single, inexpensive unlighted buoy in the center of the site and to augment the site with other reef material in the future. Thus, several platforms can be reefed within one 4000' square reef site while posing minimal spaceuse conflicts for future oes operations and for other users of the OCS (e .g., shrimp trawlers). As Herb mentioned in the teleconference, MMS policy is that reef sites be separated by >5 miles. This distance is needed to allow for future pipeline or development activities. In the case of SP 62, if MMS had approved of the two 4000' square reef sites, <1000' would have separated the two sites hindering future OCS activity in the block. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thanks Jamie!

Lesley, The specific platform which was denied was SP 62 A. The platform is in the central planning area off the coast of MS. and was denied in February. It is my understanding Apache has done clean up work around this platform. Specifically, pipelines abandoned in place per MMS regulations, structures have been cut back of loose and damage members to allow access to wells. Additionally, they have cut members placed around the bottom to add overall reef material. Wells were also plugged per MMS regulations. Deck will be recovered in 2010. Any chance we can talk with your folks again now that I have more specifics?

Offshore Section 6.xls (27 KB} ...

Steve, Section 6 leases issued on the State of Louisiana's 1942 lease form do provide the lessee the option to pay royalties in kind or in value. Following is the specific lease term language for oil. The language for gas is similar: "" Should sulfur, potash, oil, gas, and/or other liquid hydro-carbon mineral [sic] be produced in paying quantities on the premises hereunder, then the said lessee shall deliver to lessor as royalty, free of expense: 1/8 of all oil produced and saved, including distillate or other liquid hydro-carbons, delivery of said oil to be understood as made when same has been received by the first purchaser thereof. Or lessee may, in lieu of said oil delivery and at its option, pay to lessor sums equal to the value thereof on the premises; provided no deductions or charges shall be made for gathering or transporting said oil to the purchaser thereof, .. ."" Section 6 leases are unique in that those Section 6 leases that were issued on the State of Louisiana's 1942 lease form do not allow deductions for transportation or processing . So, it would not be economical for the Federal government to take production from Section 6 leases in kind. We have verified that we are not taking any gas royalties in kind from any Section 6 leases issued on the 1942 lease form in kind. For oil, we are taking oil in kind from 28 Section 6 leases issued on 1942 form. For 14 of those, oil is being transported by the operator to the onshore market center. We will verify whether or not the operators are claiming a transportation allowance on the Form MMS-2014. We are researching the other 14 Section 6 leases from which we are taking oil royalties in kind. In 1995, there were 119 leases in existence that were issued on the State of Louisiana 1942 lease form. The attached includes additional details that provide more context.

Steve, In Lyn's absence, I have asked our offshore folks and I have an answer for you regarding Section 6 leases. Section 6 leases refer to section 6 of the OeSLA (see page 12 from the link below) http://epw.senate.gov/ocsla.pdf . Offshore leasing began with the states leasing off their coasts -- as such, they leased off their coasts but on the oes (Federal waters). Section 6 provides for us to maintain those leases. In the Gulf of Mexico, the lease numbers issued by MMS (or her predecessor agency -- BLM) would have a ""G"" prefix; Section 60eS leases issued by the state don't have that prefix. There are leases maintained under section 6 that are still producing. Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thank you!

Hey Lyn, We've heard a bit from Puerto Rico recently about their interest in having their EEZ included in the OCS (for renewable energy purposes). This makes us think about the other territories as well, and it seems to me that this could be simply accomplished by amending Section 2(g) of the Submerged Lands Act to broaden the definition of State to include the territories (although Puerto Rico has a 9-mile territorial sea, so there might need to be some extra language in there to protect that). Could you guys let me know if you think this would work, or if there's something more complex that we would need to do legislatively to make this happen (if we wanted to make it happen - I'm just gathering info right now). Also, are there any trade-ofts that would be involved here for the territories - that is, are there any reasons they might not want to be included in the OCS?

Thanks

Hi Stratton, I have answers to your inquiry below. Please let me know if you need anything further. Thanks so much!

1. How far are companies able to drill horizontally with directional drilling? Currently, companies are able to drill horizontally to about 40,000 feet. (See below for specifics). However, with technological improvements this may result is longer reach wells.
Onshore drilling differs from offshore in two ways (currently -- again technology may change this). First, rigs that work offshore are smaller than what can conceivable be used onshore. Secondly, offshore drilling begins with drilling vertically before beginning the horizontal component. Onshore drilling may begin drilling at an angle.

2. What is the largest range a rig is producing with horizontal drilling/directional drilling? On the OCS: Well SA-15 measured depth is 33,435 ft; horizontal offset (reach) is 29,720 ft. is currently producing
Well SA-16 proposed measured depth is 38,088 ft; is proposed horizontal offset is 34,272 ft. Both are in the Pacific OCS. Thanks! Lesley Haenny Office of Congressional Affairs Office of the Director Minerals Management Service U.S. Department of the Interior T: (202) 208-6098 F: (202) 208-3968

What is going on? The simplistic answer is that a federal lessee would not be able to horizontally drill into the seabed under state waters to produce state resources without the state's permission; nor would a state lessee be able to horizontally drill into the federal seabed and produce federal resources without permission . However, with the appropriate Federal and State permits, leases, rights of way, etc., yes, this scenario can occur. A current example. The Liberty project In AK OCS; a company is the Federal lessee and also the lessee of the adjacent state lease. Oil was discovered underlying the Federal lease. The lessee made the business decision to place the facility on their state lease. They applied for and received the necessary drilling and development permits separately from MMS and the State and horizontally drilled from their state lease to the production zone of their Federal lease and is producing federal oil. If you need additional information please let us know.

By opening up new offshore areas for natural gas and oil leasing and developmcnt andalsQ allowing for the development of renewable energy as proposed in the DPP, the Department of the lntcrior can provide the United States with an opportunity to responsibly produce our own energy. This development will bolster our nation ' s economy, create new jobs and decrease our dependence on foreif,rtl sources of energy.
It is more impoltanl than ever that the federal government allow for development of domestic offshore energy supplies made available in the DPP. By offering new leasing opportunities, the DPP is appropriately expansive and provides the Department with maximum f1cxibilityto properly utilize our nation's domestic resolln.:es. Now is the appropriate time to promote long-term policies that respons ibly encourage job crs;:ation while growing the ec:onomy.lmportant offshore areas, like those in Alaska, offer tremendous natural gas and oil resOurces. By 80m;! estimates, the Chukchi Sea alone orf Alaska's coast contains as much natural gas and oil as the country has produced in the Gulf of Mexico since 1942.

Additionally, \VC urge MMS to move for-yard with the 2007-2012 Leasing Program while working to approve and finalize the nev"" OPP. Implementing a sensible, forward-thinking energy policy will allow for responsible leasing: and development of America's eIler!:,'), resources and will help industries and businesses here at home that rely heavily on natural gas and crude oil. It \\'ill also further our national secul""ityand energy security interests and, of course, spur jobs and economic growth as \ve open new areas to leasing and development.
In conclusion, we arc pleased to sec that the MMS has included new leasing arcas in the DPP and has acknowledged the need for the United States to begin responsibly developing the abundant energy resources located off our coasts . We believe that the DPP is an important step in creating a robust, diverse, national energy policy which will help secure our energy future. We urge you to move fonvard on the DPP as you work to finalize a new live-year OCS plan. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Please do not hesitate to contact us ihve can be of assistance to Sincerelv

Stratton , I have been trying to call you , but the Senate switchboard and the Senator's direct line is swamped! What is going on? The simplistic answer is that a federal lessee would not be able to horizontally drill into the seabed under state waters to produce state resources without the state's permission ; nor would a state lessee be able to horizontally drill into the federal seabed and produce federal resources without permission . However, with the appropriate Federal and State permits, leases, rights of way, etc., yes, this scenario can occur. A current example. The Liberty project In AK OCS ; a company is the Federal lessee and also the lessee of the adjacent state lease. Oil was discovered underlying the Federal lease. The lessee made the business decision to place the facility on their state lease. They applied for and received the necessary drilling and development permits separately from MMS and the State and horizontally drilled from their state lease to the production zone of their Federal lease and is producing federal oil. If you need additional information please let us know.

Hi Stratton, I have answers to your inquiry below. Please let me know if you need anything further. Thanks so much!

1. How far are companies able to drill horizontally with directional drilling? Currently, companies are able to drill horizontally to about 40,000 feet. (See below for specifics). However, with technological improvements this may result is longer reach wells.
Onshore drilling differs from offshore in two ways (currently -- again technology may change this). First, rigs that work offshore are smaller than what can conceivable be used onshore. Secondly, offshore drilling begins with drilling vertically before beginning the horizontal component. Onshore drilling may begin drilling at an angle.

2. What is the largest range a rig is producing with horizontal drilling/directional drilling? On the OCS: Well SA-15 measured depth is 33,435 ft; horizontal offset (reach) is 29,720 ft. is currently producing
Well SA-16 proposed measured depth is 38,088 ft; is proposed horizontal offset is 34,272 ft. Both are in the Pacific OCS. Thanks! Lesley Haenny Office of Congressional Affairs Office of the Director Minerals Management Service U.S. Department of the Interior T: (202) 208-6098 F: (202) 208-3968

Lesley, I have a question about drilling technology I'm hoping you might be able to help with. How far are companies able to drill horizontally with directional drilling? I realize there is prob. a difference between onshore and offshore - in this case let's say offshore. What is the largest range a rig is producing with horizontal drilling/directional drilling?

Page 213 FY 09 Green Book - Oc. ..

Steve, the only relief authority in pre 1996 was end of life relief under OCSLA for which companies could apply and prove that production could not continue without relief. I will check to see if an analysis was every done on pre-1996. The Green Book, page 214 (attached) provides estimates of royalties, including estimates of royalty free production for deep water and deep gas for FY 08 through FY 2013. MMS is working on an analysis of the impact of Kerr McGee. I will check on the timing, but our next update to Sen. Feinstein wasn't expected until the end/first of the year. It would be difficult at best to answer the question ""What the royalties would have been if there wasn't relief'. What criteria would be used? Without the relief some of the projects wouldn't have been explored and/or developed. I will work with our folks tomorrow and will get back with you.

I'd also like to get data on pre-199B royalty relief, if applicable.

Hi Lyn, Now that I'm out from under the hearings, I'm starting to focus on royalty relief again - and I'm realizing that I never put enough time into really understanding all the details of post-2000 royalty relief. Can I get additional details on the number of leases (and the companies that own those leases) that have received royalty relief for leases issued outside 1995-2000? I'd be interested in knowing under what category the suspension volumes fall, the amount of the suspension volume per lease, the amount produced by the lease so far. the amount that has actually been royalty free , the amount of production that has been royalty free this year (or may become royalty free once MMS finalizes the 2009 gas price calculation - and , actually, I could use some clarification here as to when the eligible leases actually get the allowed royalty relief. Is that month-by-month, or do they wait until the end of the year?) due to natural gas prices falling below the price thresholds , and the estimated amount of royalties not paid due to the royalty relief. I'm not sure if I'm making this all entirely clear, but I'm looking for as much information as possible to be able to answer the inevitable questions coming my way. I could certainly discuss this early next week to clarify what I'm looking for in the incredibly likely event that I haven't been entirely clear in the above paragraph. Thanks , --Steve

Steve, There have been 51 blocks on 50 leases (2 of the 51 blocks are included in a unit) which have earned a royalty suspension volume (RSV) and used that RSV on production from 68 qualified wells. The magnitude of that production was 303 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas. The data are through June, 2009. In addition, there were 15 leases which earned a royalty suspension supplement (RSS) for drilling an eligible dry hole. Six of these leases did not use any of the RSS that was earned . Four of these six have expired. The other nine leases were able to apply 21 bcf equivalent of the earned RSS to other gas or oil production on the lease or unit. None of the eligible wells or leases were in 200-400 meters of water depth , and none were associated with a qualified we"" drilled deeper than 20,000 feet subsea after 2005, i.e. , none were related to the EPAct provisions .

Dear Fred, Anita is out today and she wanted me to answer your question. The short answer is no, all companies pay federal royalties on OCS lands. However, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant royalty relief to promote increased oil and gas production. MMS offers royalty relief at certain times (such as with water depth, volume produced, resource prices, and in some cases, drilling depth) and to certain leases to promote development or increased production , or to encourage production of marginal resources on both producing and non-producing leases. The time and location of the lease sale from which the lease was issued are also important criteria in determining royalty relief. Whether or not a lease has royalty relief, the amount, and conditions surrounding the relief are dependent on what laws were applicable at the time of the lease issuance. The link below will give you general information on the different types and amounts of royalty relief available on federal OCS waters. Please note that some relief is mandated by statute. http://www.mms.gov/econ/econROY.htm Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thanks!!

Under incentive-based programs, potential and actu'al owners of leases within broad categories are encouraged to acquire and invest in risky oil and gas prospects in frontier or high cost areas by providing them with an opportunity to generate higher returns should they make a commercial discovery and subsequently develop and produce oil and gas from a lease within the designated category. Incentive-based relief generally results in significant forgone royalty because it applies to all production resulting from a category of leases including any production which would have occurred under current conditions without relief. On the other hand, need-based relief is designed to prevent that fiscal cost by applying relief only to production that MMS determines would not occur otherwise. Substantial and sustained oil and gas price increases in recent years have reduced the role for both kinds of royalty relief. While lease contracts, regulations, and statutory mandates keep these programs in effect, price threshold provisions have largely resulted in the discontinuation of most forms of royalty relief, with the exception of those leases issued under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, as noted below. The current role of royalty relief is mainly to provide lessees with some insurance protection against a collapse of oil and gas prices.

Categories:
Deep Water Royalty Relief: The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA) of 1995 represents the most prominent application of incentive-base royalty relief. The DWRRA enhanced the competitiveness of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) relative to other investment opportunities available to the multinational oil industry. During the mandated five years following enactment of the DWRRA, GOM leases in water at least 200 meters deep were issued and became eligible for large, congressionally mandated royalty suspension volumes, under which oil and gas could be extracted and sold royalty free. The number of DWRRA leases sold , 3401, was about four times greater than the aggregate level of deepwater leasing in the five years preceding DWRRA, and according to MMS estimates, resulted in 2,000 extra blocks being leased during the 1996-2000 period. About 300 of these DWRRA leases are still active and currently account for about fifteen percent of deepwater production . The DWRRA also established a need-based royalty relief program for deepwater leases issued before 1996 to stimulate investment in a large set of existing leases that had, for the most part, not commenced production. MMS devised a system to structure applications and conduct a comprehensive field evaluation to determine whether a given discovery that had not yet produced actually needed royalty relief to become economic. From 1997 through 2005, MMS evaluated nine applications , denying two and approving seven , but rescinding relief in two of the originally approved cases for non-performance. Price thresholds for these pre-DWRRA leases were set in statute at a level (about $38.08/bbl oil and $4.76/MMBtu gas expressed in 2009 dollars) that has suspended this relief every year since 2004 for oil and since 2000 for gas except for 2002. Since the price thresholds for oil and gas have been exceeded since 2004 , applications for this form of need-based relief have ceased. Moreover, even if oil and gas prices should decline below threshold levels, there are not likely to be many remaining deepwater leases issued prior to 1996 that would still be eligible to apply for this form or relief, i.e., active but never produced. After the mandatory five-year leasing period under the DWRRA ended in 2000, MMS chose to continue incentive-based deepwater royalty relief for newly issued GOM leases in water at least 400 meters deep under the discretionary authority of the oes Lands Act, as amended by DWRRA.. However, the amount of this categorical relief was specified on a sale-by-sale basis, rather than set in the regulations. Also, MMS set much smaller suspension volumes than those set in the DWRRA, and reflected the fact that a large geologiC field typically overlies multiple tracts as defined on the oes. These MMS suspension volumes were in fact set at less than one-fifth of those set in the DWRRA. They were also accompanied by similar or the same price thresholds as would apply under the DWRRA to deepwater leases issued prior to 1996 which qualified for need-based relief. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) directed that the royalty suspension volumes which MMS had used in lease sales since 2001 would continue to apply to all new leases in similar water depths issued in GOM sales through early August 2010. MMS was authorized to apply price threshold conditions at its discretion to these incentives, which it did by continuing with those

used under this program. EPAct also added another tier of royalty relief in the form of higher royalty suspension volumes than MMS had stipulated for leases to be issued in water depths of 2000 meters or greater. From 2001 through 2009, over 3900 additional deepwater leases have been issued in the GOM with this style categorical royalty relief and currently account for about three percent of deepwater production. In designing regulations and lease terms to implement the statutory provisions of the DWRRA, MMS was subject to two lawsuits for its interpretation that the Act allowed or implied certain important limiting conditions , e.g., that relief would not apply to leases on fields that previously produced, that the amount of relief was to be shared by leases on the same field, and, that price thresholds stipulated in the DWRRA for the need-based program could be applied to the incentive- based program as well. The courts subsequently ruled against the Department's' position and judgment on all counts for the ways in which the DWRRA should be interpreted , i.e., the way Congress meant or should have meant it to read, resulting in an estimated loss to tax payers of about $25 billion. Ironically and unfortunately, MMS had through administrative error inadvertently omitted price thresholds on DWRRA leases issued in 1998 and 1999. Both the Congress and the MMS Director requested investigations , and neither one found any intent by MMS employees or anyone else for that matter to purposely omit price thresholds. In the end, the courts' decisions that the DWRRA did not provide a price threshold authority for the incentive-based program made inclusion or omission of price thresholds by MMS in leases or regulations moot.

Alaska Rovalty Relief: MMS has issued over 700 leases offshore Alaska with incentive-based royalty suspension volumes since 2003. The EPAct extended the authority to grant pre-production royalty relief following a discovery to existing leases offshore Alaska . Regulations detailing the case-by-case process used for need-based royalty relief in the GOM were revised in 2008, based on the provisions in EPAct, to apply to leases offshore Alaska as well. Deep Gas Royalty Relief: MMS initiated an incentive-based royalty relief program in 2001 for newly issued leases aimed at production of gas from deep wells at least 15,000 feet subsea on leases in the shallow waters of the GOM. While shallow water in the GOM is not by itself a frontier area like deepwater or offshore Alaska, promising reservoirs at these deep depths in shallow water are expensive to drill and largely unexplored. Since 2001 , MMS has issued leases in water less than 200 meters deep with royalty relief for drilling and production of these deep wells for the purpose of encouraging added deep gas activity. In a 2003 regulation, MMS refined the form of the deep gas drilling incentive to vary by drilling depth and type of well drilled , and also expanded the incentive to include all pre-2001 leases in shallow water that had not previously produced from deep depths. These pre-2001 leases probably contain a significant portion of the deep gas potential as well as substantial in-place infrastructure needed to produce deep gas. For these leases, MMS set a price threshold of about $10.62/MMBtu in 2009 dollars and stipulated a fixed expiration date of May 3,2009 for starting production from deep wells to earn relief. The intent was to encourage accelerated drilling of this gas source while minimizing the cost of the program. Currently, 54 of these leases qualified for this relief and produced about two percent of all natural gas in the GOM.
The EPAct required MMS to expand deep gas relief to include existing and new leases in 200-400 meters of water and increased the royalty suspension volume for ultra-deep wells at least 20,000 feet subsea by 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas production royalty free beyond the level provided in the MMS-initiated program. MMS issued a regulation in 2007 activating this expanded incentive, along with a price threshold level equal to that used for gas in its current deepwater program. The market prices for natural gas have been above the threshold levels every year since mid-2003, but it appears that this will not be the case in 2009 .

Other Royalty Relief: Finally, MMS offers need-based royalty relief on a case-by-case basis under 2 other programs. o End-of-life relief cuts royalty rates in half for producing leases that demonstrate financial loss over the most recent year at existing royalty rates. This program is most important in the Pacific oes where re-Ieasing of abandoned tracts is not permitted. It was used for about eight fields there in the 1990's, but price threshold provisions relative to market prices have since ended relief for all but one field. This one field uses an older incentive program called net revenue share relief that does not rely on price thresholds. In an effort to provide similar late-stage relief to marginally economic leases in the GOM, EPAct directed MMS to assess the merits of a categorical marginal property royalty relief program. After a careful effort to design and evaluate such a program, 001 issued a formal finding in February 2007 that it is not practical or cost-effective to do so.

o

Special circumstance relief allows leases for which the end-of-life, deep gas or deepwater programs are unavailable or inadequate to seek royalty relief. To do so, the lease must meet certain criteria indicating that relief would fulfill statutory goals for relief, such as promote development, increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on certain leases. The regulation for this program merely establishes a process for seeking such relief outside the formal royalty relief programs but does not constrain the form or nature of that relief. MMS has evaluated about one special case royalty relief request a year under this authority over the last decade and approved relief in all but one case.

Summary of oes Deepwater Leases Royalty Relief .,. Chart 11-5-09...

Steve, For discussion, if we exclude the leasing experiments of 1978-1983 royalty relief was not included in lease terms until 1996, and the only royalty relief available prior to 1996 involved MMS approval of case-specific applications. By law prior to the DWRRA, the projects considered for royalty relief had to have been in production, and by regulation, those projects received royalty relief only if MMS did not expect them to continue to produce absent the royalty relief provided, as is the case for all of our need-based royalty relief programs. Accordingly, we would argue there was no anticipated net cost of royalty relief before 1996. Given the ad hoc and limited nature of the royalty relief program prior to 1996, we do not have a systematic data base that keeps track of the production amounts that were generated under different types of those royalty relief arrangements. Beginning in 1996, we have several data base systems which track the volumes (not the values) of royalty relief provided under various MMS and statutory programs. However, as is almost always the case with categorical type programs in which specific project need is not the basis for approval of royalty relief, we cannot say objectively how much of the royalty free production either was expected to be produced without the royalty incentive or was actually produced without the incentive. The calculation you propose below would represent a maximum royalty cost since some of the production would not have occurred absent relief and because some of the added production might be subject to paying some royalties, e.g., after the suspension volumes are reached. The actual calculations of the value of the royalty relief not only involve resource price levels that are not precisely equal to average annual levels taken from some publicly available index, but also require adjustments for project specific transportation and processing costs not available publicly in any form . However, attached is information on January - June 2009 natural gas and oil production from post 2000 leases with deep water relief, and January - June 2009 royalty-free natural gas production from

Subject: RE: Question regarding deep gas royalty relief
Thanks, Lyn. The tables from the green books are somewhat useful, but are limited since they project gas prices above the thresholds (the FY10 green book has an FY09 gas price estimate of $6). As for my question about what royalties would be without relief, I'm trying to keep things simple here ... basically, if there was 100 Bcf of gas produced royalty-free because the price was so low, what would we have collected in royalties on that 100 Bet if there was no royalty relief. I could do this calculation myself if I had the royalty free production and the average price that year (assuming the average royalty rates given in Table 49 of the Green Book), but I'd prefer to actually have an estimate from MMS when someone invariably asks me for this (and since we're proposing to repeal the EPACT05 royalty relief provisions in our bill, someone will be asking me for this) .

Subject: RE: Question regarding deep gas royalty relief
Steve, the only relief authority in pre 1996 was end of life relief under OCSLA for which companies could apply and prove that production could not continue without relief. I will check to see if an analysis was every done on pre-1996. The Green Book, page 214 (attached) provides estimates of royalties, including estimates of royalty free production for deep water and deep gas for FY 08 through FY 2013. MMS is working on an analysis of the impact of Kerr McGee. I will check on the timing, but our next update to Sen. Feinstein wasn't expected until the end/first of the year. It would be difficult at best to answer the question ""What the royalties would have been if there wasn't relief'. What criteria would be used? Without the relief some of the projects wouldn't have been explored and/or developed. I will work with our folks tomorrow and will get back with you .

Hi Lyn, Now that I'm out from under the hearings , I'm starting to focus on royalty relief again - and I'm realizing that I never put enough time into really understanding all the details of post-2000 royalty relief. Can I get additional details on the number of leases (and the companies that own those leases) that have received royalty relief for leases issued outside 1995-2000? I'd be interested in knowing under what category the suspension volumes fall, the amount of the suspension volume per lease, the amount produced by the lease so far, the amount that has actually been royalty free, the amount of production that has been royalty free this year (or may become royalty free once MMS finalizes the 2009 gas price calculation - and, actually, I could use some clarification here as to when the eligible leases actually get the allowed royalty relief. Is that month-by-month, or do they wa it until the end of the year?) due to natural gas prices falling below the price thresholds, and the estimated amount of royalties not paid due to the royalty relief. I'm not sure if I'm making this all entirely clear, but I'm looking for as much information as possible to be able to answer the inevitable questions coming my way.

If I understand correctly, the current 5-year lease program ends mid-2012, and the regular start date for developing a new 5-year program would be July 1,2010 with expected completion July 1, 2012. That's the 2 years you identify ""from start to publication of the final Program."" In the schematic, that is the last box called ""Leases Issued,"" second line under ""Pre-lease."" Correct? The current 5-year program is set to expire on June 30, 2012; therefore a new program would need to be effective no later than July 1, 2012 . In a typical cycle, we would start the public process under Section 18 with publication of a Request for Information at least 2 years before a current program is set to expire. That is for the 5-year planning process only. The Bush Administration in 2008 started to develop a draft program and targeted July 1, 2009 to announce a new 5year program that included the formerly off-limits OCS areas. The hope was that leases could be issued by July 1, 2010, 2 years earlier than the expiration of the current lease program in 2012. Correct? The 5-year program determines the size, timing, and location of lease sales for that 5-year period. The lease sale
1

process also has multiple steps that include opportunities for public comment, state consultation under section 19 of the OCSLA, NEPA analysis and review, consistency under CZMA, and other statutes as appropriate . The lease process takes 2-3 years generally depending on the area with more time in frontier areas such as Alaska. In general the first sale in a 5-year program will be scheduled to occur at least a month after the effective date of the program, therefore the first leases issued under an approved program would be 2-3 months later. For example, the current program was effective July 1, 2007. The first sale was held in mid-August 2007 in the Western Gulf of Mexico. In the post lease phase, you say it usually takes 2-3 years for exploration drilling to start. That would imply 2012-2013 under the accelerated target dates for program development and 2014-2015 under business as usual. Commercial production, in most cases, would add another 2-3 years averaging 5 years total from lease issuance, i.e., 2014-2016 accelerated and 2016-2018 business as usual. Correct? In frontier areas, I assume this includes areas subject to the moratoria that were lifted only last year, it could take more than 10 years from lease issuance to commercial production, i.e., at least to 2020 accelerated and 2022 business as usual. These dates assume the lease program development process itself stays within 2 years for such areas . Correct? Leases are issued on the basis of competitive cash-bidding at an announced lease sale, generally within 90 days of the lease sale. Once a lease is issued, a lessee must have an exploration plan (EP) approved before conducting any exploration activities, other than ""preliminary"" activities necessary to prepare the plan. An EP is subject to NEPA and CZMA in particular. Any wells drilled pursuant to an EP need an approved Application for Permit to Drill (APD). In the most mature areas of the Gulf, exploration might occur within a year. Time needed to prepare an EP and the necessary reviews (NEPA, CZMA) increase significantly as you move into frontier areas with less information, possible drilling windows (i.e. weather seasons in the Arctic), and conditions requiring more specialized and harder-to-obtain drilling rigs (i.e. deeper water) . If there is a discovery, a lessee must submit a Development and Production Plan (DPP) for approval. Like the EP, the DPP is subject to NEPA and CZMA in particular and the requirement for an APD for any wells. It is possible to have commercial production in less than 2 years, under very special circumstances, such as drilling into a known reservoir so exploration activity would be little or none, use of existing facilities such as a platform on an adjacent lease, etc. In general a lease is required to be producing ""in paying quantities"" within the initial term of the lease, 5 to 10 years, or the lease expires. However, there are circumstances that toll the term of lease, including necessary governmental reviews and approvals (federal, state and/or local), time to obtain and conduct necessary activities (i.e. scarcity of rigs capable of drilling in deepwater may mean waiting for existing rigs to be available or contracting to buy new), etc. Production might depend on building new infrastructure, either offshore or onshore (pipelines, platforms, processing facilities, etc.). The time to commercial production could and has taken more than a decade for a myriad of reasons.

Mr. Boll , I apologize it took me so long to get this out to you today. I got swept up in a few ""fire-drills"" after we spoke and have just managed to get a few of them off of my plate . In regards to the time it takes to develop a 5 Year Program, generally speaking it takes 2 years from start to publication of the final Program. The fastest this has been accomplished in is 1Bmonths, but that was an extremely compressed and stressful timeline to meet. From the issuance of a lease to the first exploratory well will generally take 2-3 years. In an extremely well known and developed area, this can be accomplished faster (perhaps a year or so), but this is extremely rare, and they would almost have to be using existing infrastructure from an adjacent lease. From lease to first commercial production, this will generally occur within the lease primary term (5yrs in most cases). There are leases that come into production sooner (-2yrs), but they would be in similar situations as described above. For ""frontier areas"" (i.e. ultra-deep water) with no existing infrastructure or well developed knowledge of the geology, this process can take more than a decade. As you can see, there is a very large spread in these timeframes. The short timeframes assume there were no problems or delay with CZM consistency, NEPA, or other consultations (which may not be an accurate assumption). Please feel free to contact me with any further questions. I have CC'd Lyn Herdt and Lesley Haenny in our office of

To: Herdt, Lyn; Haenny, Lesley Subject: contact information Lynn and Lesley -- We have a constituent who is interested in a wave energy conversion project - I think of a pilot project nature. I wanted to pass on the contact information for they might be in touch with to find out how they would go about applying for a permit from MMS. They are in town here through Wednesday. Is there someone in DC or Herndon they could discuss this with - or is this being handled in the region? As I understand it, the constituent is looking for process advice, and I wanted to pOint them in the right direction. Thanks, Patty

Hi Lyn,

I didn't quite get through the Green Book as quickly as I wanted to, but now that FY1 0 has started, I figured I should send you those questions that I have and get ready for FY11. I have 11 questions that relate directly to issues in the Green Book, and then two other additional questions that don't directly relate to the budget. Let me know if I need to clarify any of these.
Thanks, --Steve

FY10 MMS Green Book Questions

1. Why were cost recovery fees split out from offsetting receipts in 2009, but are lumped back into offsetting receipts in 2010 (as they were in years before 2009)?
Answer: Offsetting collections are composed of certain OCS rental receipts and cost recovery fees that MMS is authorized to retain. The FY 2010 budget contained a proposal for a new inspection fee for OCS facilities that would be retained by MMS. Each of these -- retained rental receipts, cost recovery fees, and the new inspection fee -- are offsetting receipts and the level of display detail is determined in consultation with OMB. The level of offsetting rental receipts and cost recovery fees are driven by external economic factors and industry activities. In the FY 2010 budget, rental receipts and cost recovery fees were presented together to provide a succinct presentation of the bureau's budget request and highlight the new inspection fee.

2. Why isn't the ESP a separate subactivity? It seems that the functions of the ESP are distinct from the rest of LE, and the advantages that MMS claims will be gained by a new renewable energy subactivity would also be gained by a separate ESP subactivity.
Answer: Funding for the Environmental Studies Program (ESP) is a subset of the Leasing and Environmental Assessment Sub activity. ESP is intimately related to preparation and execution of the Five-Year Oil and Gas Program, as the information acquired by these studies is used to support management decisions for the oil and gas program, and now the Renewable Energy program. Environmental Studies for the sand and gravel program represent only $500,000 in dedicated funding, and while the Renewable Energy program is growing, most ESP funds do support the oil and gas program. Also, by residing in the LEA Sub activity, if additional funds are needed for NEP A compliance work to support the execution of a new five-year program, MMS could do so quickly within existing reprogramming guidelines. It should be noted that this capability will be especially important as the administration makes decisions on the direction of the new five-year program. Depending upon the outcome of these decisions, planning areas previously under moratoria may be newly available, requiring additional environmental studies and analysis. At this time MMS believes that funding for this program should remain in the Leasing and Environmental Sub activity.

3. The amount of money brought in per dollar spent on compliance has gone up significantly since the FY09 Green Book - it's $8.55 for each dollar spent on audits from FY06 to FY08, whereas from FY04 through FY06 it was $5.01 for each dollar spent on compliance reviews and $3.56 for each dollar spent on audits. What is the breakdown for compliance reviews vs. audits for the FY06 - FY08 time period? And what is the reason for the considerable increase?
Answer: The benefit-cost ratio breakdown for FY 2006 - FY 2008 is Compliance Reviews $4.44: 1 and Audits $8.55:1. The dramatic increase in the benefit-cost ratio for audits and the overall program increase is due to the Burlington settlement ($105,300,000 during FY 2007). Without this settlement the audit benefit-cost ratio is $4.76:1.

4. What is an ""operator performance audit""? [Mentioned on page 13-14 under ""Current 5-year Program""]
Answer: MMS conducts several types of ""audits"" related to operator performance. MMS performs an annual performance review on every operator. This review begins with an MMS analysis of the results of the operator's inspections comparing non-compliance actions issued by MMS to the complexity of their operations as evidenced by the number of equipment components operating during the course of the year. This statistical analysis is the first filter for determining if the company will be called in to the region or district for face-to-face meetings, and if the company is performing at acceptable levels and does not need to meet with MMS. Both of
2

these actions constitute an annual operator performance review. MMS may also require operators that demonstrate an incomplete knowledge of the regulations during an inspection to come in for a performance review. And finally, any operator that has had a history of accidents or near-miss events may also be subject to a performance review with MMS. This program has been active for the past twelve years and has been very successful in redirecting poorer performers into the acceptable realm. Additionally, under anticipate regulatory changes in the recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Safety Management Systems, MMS is planning to conduct audits of any company's safety management system that has had compliance problems or significant and/or chronic accidents. This audit will examine several elements relating to the management of an operation such as mechanical integrity; operational procedures; management of change; and hazards analysis. MMS has determined that these four elements contribute to over 90% of the accidents occurring on the OCS. These audits are labor and time intensive and require a systems approach to understanding and ensuring safety management. Finally, MMS conducts accident investigation audits of serious events occurring on a facility, such as a fatality, a serious injury, or a major fire. These audits require onsite investigations and interviews of the company workforce to determine the sequence of events that led to the accident. Information derived from accident investigation audits is extremely valuable and often results in MMS-issued Safety Alerts or even changes to regulations. 5. The budget proposes a decrease in ""Implement OIG Compliance and Audit Recommendations"" of $1.156 million, although that initiative had a request of $2 million in the FY09 budget (with 4 FTEs). Is it correct to assume that the large ""ongoing operations"" costs ($844,000) primarily cover the 4 FTEs that would still be on staff? Answer: The $844,000 represents ongoing full-year funding of $568,000 for 4 FTE, plus $276,000 for ongoing systems operations costs. Generally, MRM estimates continuing support at approximately 20% of the initial investment. As IT system functionality is expanded and significant enhancements are made to the MRMSS, in addition to the initial investment, there are often increased ongoing operations and support costs for the overall system. These costs include patches for ongoing updates, additional contract labor, code modifications when new releases of the underlying software are incorporated, ongoing security patches, mandated system changes from outside sources, and minor software adjustments to support and increase efficiency as platforms and inter-related software changes. 6. The decrease in ""Improve Automated Interest Billing to Companies"" is $1.36 million, while the FY09 request for that initiative was $1.7 million with zero FTEs. Does that mean this initiative requires $340,000 in continuing operations costs, and what exactly are those costs? Answer: Yes there are ongoing operations costs. Please see the response to question 5. 7. Of the 7.08:1 ratio for compliance activities (or 5.08:1 ratio without Burlington), how does that break down for audits vs. compliance reviews? That is, what are the cost:benefit ratios separately for audits and compliance reviews? Answer: The benefit-cost ratio for FY 2005-2007, excluding the FY 2007 Burlington settlement, is $5.49:1 for compliance reviews and $4.71: 1 for audits. 8. Could you explain a little more about the fact that contractor assistance will now be needed to prepare the 5-year plan EIS? What does it mean that ""MMS must now use funds intended for other important oil and gas programs to acquire contractor assistance in preparing the
3

document""? What ""other important programs""? [po 65] Answer: Development of the FY 2010 budget began at a time when MMS was accelerating development of a new Five-Year Program at the direction of the previous administration. At that time, MMS anticipated it would need to begin scoping meetings, public hearings, and environmental work in 2009 and into 2010 to prepare for a new 2010-2015 Five-Year Program. In order to do so, redirection of funding from other program areas was being considered to fund this effort, the most likely candidates being other activities funded in the Leasing and Environmental Subactivity, such as studies and assessments. The delay in key decisions related to the FiveYear Program to FY 2010 relieved the pressure of redirecting funds, and with the likely passage of the FY 2010 request, MMS anticipates it will not need to redirect any funding from other program areas. The use of contractor assistance in preparing the draft EIS has increased over the two past cycles as the availability of in-house resources for this task has declined, and the scope, complexity, and level of detail required has increased. Preparation for the next EIS will certainly require a greater level of effort, based on the number of public meetings held and the number of comments already submitted on the Notice of Intent. It should be noted that whenever contractor assistance is used, those documents (and/or sections) received are considered as purely draft input in to a future, final product. MMS must, and is expected to, further revise, adjust, and expand these submissions as necessary, making them our own in their entirety. 9. The budget assumes $1.5 billion over ten years due to royalty reforms and rate adjustments (p. 189) - how did MMS come up with that number? As stated in the Green Book on page 189 and by Secretary Salazar at the Committee's hearing on September 16, the Department anticipates implementing appropriate royalty rate adjustments once a review is complete. While no decision has been made on a royalty rate adjustment, the Budget estimates are based on estimated future production times a range of potential increases in royalty rates 10. In Table 42 (p. 200), the onshore rents and bonuses from coal leasing is projected to soar in FY11, going from $274 million in FY10 to $700M in FY11. In last year's projections, there were huge jumps anticipated in FY09 and FY10 (with $1.3 and $2.3 billion in rents and bonuses, respectively). Can I get a little more information on where these estimates are coming from, and why there's a huge jump expected starting in FY11? Answer: There is uncertainty in the projected sale dates. BLM has used a conservative set of assumptions for projecting sale dates. However, there remain many sources of uncertainty when projecting a coal lease sale date which can include: o o o o o o o many agencies and entities need to interact to complete processing of a coal lease application to the point of a lease sale; applicants may request a processing delay; coal lease sales could happen, but the BLM does not receive any bids that are at least equal to the presale estimate of fair market value; a shortage of resources necessary for processing applications; changes in general market for coal or economic conditions; issues that arise as a part of public participation in an Environmental Impact Statement; and other issues may arise or change over the lengthy processing time.

BLM is currently processing 34 coal lease applications that are located in 8 states. The projected revenues for coal lease sales will increase between FY20 10 and FY20 11 because BLM anticipates several very large lease applications in Wyoming to mature to the point of a coal lease sale during FY2011. While the projections show that 11 leases would be sold in FY2010 containing 1.3 billion tons, BLM expects the sale of 10 leases in FY20 11 containing a total of 2.4 billion tons. In addition, approximately 286 million tons of the additional 1.1
4

billions tons for FY2011 are from Wyoming with much higher anticipated bonus bids. Therefore, the variance between FY20 10 and FY20 11 is due to leasing larger tracts of coal that have a higher relative value. 11. In Table 46 (p. 204), the amount of on-shore natural gas production is estimated to increase slightly from 3.09 tcf in FY09 to 3.28 tcf in FY12, then go back down to 3.07 tcf by FY14. Last year's table had natural gas production increasing steadily to 3.808 tcf in FY13. What's the reason for the difference between last year's and this year's estimates? Answer: BLM estimates onshore natural gas production. Last year's estimates were based on the number of applications for permit to drill (APDs) from historical trend. Since then, there has been a significant decline in the number of APDs that were incorporated inFY 2010's estimates. Hence, the latest estimate is based on a lower number of natural gas wells being drilled and put into production. With the decline in production from existing wells, by FY 2014 the amount of replacement production will be less than the decline in production.
Non-Green-Book questions 12. In the 2006 UERR spreadsheets, MMS states that gas prices are tied to oil prices, so the individual values are not independent. It appears that they are not as well tied as previously believed. Does this affect the 2006 UERR calculations at all, or is it possible to just take the Total Liquid values corresponding to a particular oil price and the Total Gas values corresponding to a particular gas price and combine them to calculate a new BOE? Are there other places where MMS does analysis based on an assumption of linked oil & gas prices, and will those be revisited?

This response was sent to you separately on October 8

13. Does MMS or 001 keep track of production volumes of various non-conventional gas sources? That is, do we have a breakdown of how much gas on federal lands came from shales, how much from CBM, etc.?

Anita directed you to the MMS website for this information.

362545-mms1-pdf-114-474-474,"SUBJECT: Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior on Mutual Concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf

I.

SUMMARY

MMS has been consulting with the military in a collaborative manner at both the planning and operational stages for OCS oil and gas leasing activities to ensure that each agency meets the requirements of its mission while not unduly interfering with the other. This has been accomplished for 25 years under a 1983 MOA between DOl and DoD with no serious conflict.

II.

DISCUSSION:

The basic provisions of the MOA between DoD and DOl on Mutual Concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf (Effective July 20, 1983), are to resolve conflicts between the OCS leasing program and the requirements for the DOD to use the OCS for national defense and security, and set forth procedures and steps to follow when OCS lease sales are planned. Section I of the MOA very clearly identify the missions of both Departments: ""We, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior, hereby agree to establish procedures for joint use of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of the Interior (DOl) fully support the national goal of exploration and development of our nation's offshore oil and gas resources. The DOD recognizes that the OCS leasing program of the DOl is an integral part of the nation's energy security program to develop domestic oil and gas resources and thus is important to national defense. The DOl fully supports the requirement for DOD to use the OCS for the national defense/security and to ensure that our armed forces achieve and maintain an optimum state of readiness. We acknowledge that from time to time and from place to place the requirements for mineral exploration/development and defense related activities may conflict. In these cases, we shall reach mutually acceptable solutions to the issues raised by these conflicting requirements, in accordance with the principles and procedures established by this memorandum."" For the past 25 years, the coordination and consultation mechanisms set forth in the MOA have enabled DOl to continue to meet its OCS Lands Act mandate to make OCS resources available for expeditious and orderly development, while still protecting the environment, as well as allowing the DOD to meet its critical national defense and security mission.

OVERVIEW: ALASKA OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OIL & GAS PROGRAM SUMMARY The MMS held highly successful oil and gas lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas over the past five years. Companies are now pursuing exploration and development projects, and production continues at Northstar. The MMS is preparing a multiple-sale environmental impact statement for the four remaining Arctic OCS lease sales (two in the Beaufort Sea and two in the Chukchi Sea) scheduled in the 2007-2012 5-Year Program. MMS is also evaluating whether to hold sales in the North Aleutian Basin and Cook Inlet. Alaska Native coastal communities practice a traditional subsistence lifestyle and remain concerned about offshore activity. Operating conditions of the Arctic OCS pose many economic, logistical, operational, and regulatory challenges to oil and gas operations . NEW PROPOSED 5 YEAR OCS OIL AND GAS PLAN - 2010?2015 On January 16, 2009, MMS announced the release of the Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for 2010 2015. The DPP seeks public comment on all aspects of the new program for 2010-2015, including energy development and economic and environmental issues in the OCS areas . On February 10, 2009, Secretary Salazar announced an extension of the comment period on the Draft Proposed Program by 180 days, closing in late September. The additional time provides the states, stakeholders, and affected communities the opportunity to provide input on the future of our offshore areas. He also tasked the MMS and the USGS to produce a report on the offshore resources and potential impacts by the end of March. Following publication of the report, 001 will conduct 4 regional meetings, one each for the Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast, Atlantic Coast, and Alaska. In the Alaska Region, the DPP 2010?2015 proposes possible lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, Cook Inlet, and North Aleutian Basin Planning Areas, the same areas included in the existing OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program: 2007- 2012. The 2007-2012 Program remains in effect. ARCTIC - CHUKCHI AND BEAUFORT SEAS Oil and Gas Lease Sales - 2007?2012 Program Note: On April 16, the U.S. district Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on a lawsuit on the 2007-12 Program. The Court dismissed with respect to petitioners' NEPA-based climate change claim, NEPA baseline data claim, and ESA claim; the petitions be denied with respect to the petitioners' OCSLA-based climate change claims and OCSLA-rooted baseline data challenge; but it vacated and remanded the leasing program for reconsideration concerning the OCSLA required environmental sensitivity analysis .

In February 2008, MMS held its third Chukchi Sea sale, but the first in more than 16 years. Sale 193 was the most successful sale ever held in Alaska, onshore or offshore. The sale attracted 667 bids totaling nearly $3.4 billion, with 488 high bids of more than $2 .6 billion. A total of 487 leases were issued . One company decided not to pursue its lease (a $400 bid on a sliver tract). The Chukchi outlook is very promising, although with technical and environmental challenges . The Burger Prospect engendered great interest, including the high bid of $105,304,581 by Shell on one of its tracts. Burger alone may contain 14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 700 million barrels of condensate, based on existing seismic survey data and one exploration well. Prior to the Chukchi sale, MMS held sales in the Beaufort Sea (2003, 2005, and 2007) under the previous 5-Year program that brought in about $100 million and resulted in 241 leases. Ten sales have been held in the Beaufort Sea.

Future Sales
The current 5-Year Program 2007-2012 includes the following Arctic sales: o o o o Beaufort Sea Sale 209, spring 2010 Chukchi Sea Sale 212, fall 2010 Beaufort Sea Sale 217, 2011 Chukchi Sea Sale 221, 2012

MMS is preparing one EIS for the 4 sales. The Draft EIS was released on December 15, 2008. The comment period was extended to March 30, 2009. MMS held public hearings in North Slope and Chukchi Sea villages in February. MMS will determine whether to supplement the EIS for the sales scheduled in 2011 and 2012. MMS is currently continuing work to complete a Final EIS which would be released later this year. The MMS invited the North Slope Borough to be a cooperating agency on the EIS, but the NSB declined. However, MMS and the NSB did sign an MOA for the NSB to prepare a Health Impact Assessment, and work on the assessment is in progress .

Production Northstar - Northstar is a joint Federal/State of Alaska unit located in the Beaufort Sea about 12 miles northwest of Prudhoe Bay. The Unit includes three federal and five state leases . The Northstar reservoir is managed under a joint Federal/State unit agreement. British Petroleum Exploration Alaska, Inc. (BPXA) is the unit operator with controlling interest in these leases. Murphy Oil has a ten percent stake in one of the Federal leases. Northstar began production in 2001; total production through March 2009 is more than 135 million barrels, with the federal portion exceeding 24 million barrels. Development Liberty - The Liberty prospect is located in the central Beaufort Sea about 5-8 miles east of the existing Endicott Satellite Drilling Island (SOl). BP Exploration Alaska, Inc. (BPXA) proposes to use ultra Extended Reach Drilling to reach world record lengths of up to 8 miles, which will allow the Liberty unit to be developed from an expansion of the existing Endicott SOL BPXA estimates that the reserves for the Liberty prospect are 105 million barrels of oil.
MMS approved the Development and Production Plan on January 3, 2008. Fabrication and installation of well pad facilities are now under construction . The drilling unit, which was built specifically for the project, will be barged to the North Slope during the 2009 open water season. Development drilling is scheduled to start in 2010.

Exploration
Almost no exploration has occurred in the Beaufort or Chukchi Seas since 1993 - only 3 exploration wells were drilled during this 16 year period and only one since 2003. Shell and ConocoPhillips Alaska (CPAI) are planning new exploration plans to support exploratory drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Shell is planning to drill in 2010 in both the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. ConocoPhillips is planning to drill in 2011 in the Chukchi Sea . Shell has submitted its plans, which are currently under MMS review.

Ancillary Activities
Shell has been, and plans to continue in 2009, gathering onsite data to support its Exploration Plans in both the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Likewise CPAI has been and in 2009 will continue to gather data on its Chukchi leases. Shell and ConocoPhillips are both collecting environmental data in support of planned exploration activities. Both companies are coordinating their data collection efforts with the MMS environmental studies program .

NORTH ALEUTIAN BASIN Proposed Oil and Gas Lease Sale 214 - 2007-2012 Program
In 2004, Congress lifted the Congressional moratoria holding a sale in the North Aleutian Basin. In 2007, the President modified a 1998 presidential withdrawal (moratorium) in order to allow leasing in the North Aleutian Basin . MMS included the NAB for a possible sale in late 2011 within the 2007-12 OCS 5-Year Program . The MMS Alaska Region has taken the initial steps to consider an oil and gas lease sale in the North Aleutian Basin. The effort is supported by the State of Alaska and some of the tribal and local governments. However environmental organizations and other tribal groups oppose a sale. No decision has been made to hold a sale . On April 8, 2008, MMS published a federal register notice announcing a Call for Information and the Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for Sale 214 and on November 10, 2008, identified the area to be considered for leasing. MMS gathered information from the public, industry, and state, tribal and local officials about the potential lease sale, environmental concerns, other uses of the area that may be affected by the leasing, possible alternatives, lease terms, and mitigation measures . In May and June 2008, public scoping meeting were held in Anchorage, Unalaska (Dutch Harbor), Kodiak, Sand Point, Dillingham, Nelson Lagoon, Naknek, King Salmon, Cold Bay, and King Cove from mid-August through September. The formal comment period for scoping closed on October 17, 2008. However, MMS will continue to gather relevant information during the EIS process, and met with commercial fishing interests at the Pacific Marine Expo in November 2008 in Seattle. MMS Alaska Region and the Aleutians East Borough are working closely together on the sale evaluation and potential mitigation. On May 30, 2008, AEB Mayor Stanley Mack and MMS Alaska Regional Director John Goll signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by which the AEB is serving as a cooperating agency for the preparation of the EIS.

COOK INLET Lease Sales - 2007-2012 Program
The MMS included two lease sales in Cook Inlet in the 2007-2012 5-Year Program as ""Special Interest"" sales, which will take place only if enough interest is shown by industry in answer to a nomination call . The two proposed sales are Sale 211, originally scheduled for 2009; and Sale 218, tentatively scheduled for 2011 . MMS received no bids on the last two Cook Inlet Sales . In 2008 MMS completed a process of asking whether companies have sufficient interest for MMS to hold a Sale 211 in Cook Inlet, but no interest was expressed. MMS will solicit interest again in Sale 211 in 2009.

Exploration

Cosmopolitan: Cosmopolitan is a joint Federal/State of Alaska unit, located in the Lower Cook Inlet, offshore of the Kenai Peninsula, and five miles north of Anchor Point. Pioneer Natural Resources Alaska Inc., (Pioneer) is the unit operator. Pioneer completed an exploratory well in 2008 and is evaluating well results. MMS granted a suspension of operations for the two federal leases in the unit until November 14, 2010 subject to Pioneer drilling another exploratory well.
ALASKA CHALLENGES
Exploration and development face substantial challenges involving a wide variety of environmental , socio economic and technical issues. Subsistence communities along the coast are concerned about potential conflicts with their subsistence whaling in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, fishing, and hunting and impacts to other subsistence resources from OCS operations. Concerns include effects of noise, increasing vessel traffic, and the effectiveness of industry's ability to respond to and clean up an oil spill . MMS lease stipulations and rules require lessees to develop a Plan of Cooperation to avoid unreasonable conflicts with subsistence practices of rural Alaskan communities. Mitigation measures

3

U.S. Minerals Management Service

July 2009

include avoidance of subsistence hunting areas and curtailment of noise-producing activities during hunts. The ESA-listed species off Alaska include whales (bowhead, right, humpback, fin), the polar bear, northern sea otter, stellar sea lion, and spectacled and Steller's eiders. Several species of ice seals and Pacific walrus have been proposed for listing. MMS regularly completes ESA section 7 consultations with both the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (whales) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) (polar bears and eiders) for activity in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas . MMS will consult in the future for possible offshore activity connected with the NAB Sale . All marine mammals are also protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Operations are affected by ice, which must be accounted for in exploration and production. Remoteness, lack of support infrastructure and services (shore bases , pipelines, etc.), short open-water operating seasons , logistical expenses for equipment and staff, ice pack and scour, and delays related to litigation are all challenges to OCS exploration, development, and production. In accordance with MMS regulations, companies are planning and addressing these issues, and are investing in appropriate drilling vessels for the Arctic operating conditions, Operators must also comply with permitting requirements from multiple federal and state agencies and with MMS operating regulations. MMS operating regulations have been developed and refined over the last 25 years. The regulations establish many of the requirements and procedures that serve to protect the environment from undue harm , minimize multiple-use conflicts, prevent pollution and oil spills , and manage spill response.

OFFSHORE RESEARCH

Alaska Environmental Studies Program
From 1973 through 2008, the 001 Offshore Program has directed approximately $300 million into environmental studies in the Alaska OCS Region to produce more than 400 different study reports. In terms of scale, longevity, and breadth of coverage, the ESP constitutes one of the most comprehensive data collection efforts anywhere in the world to assess biological and social impacts from economic development activities. The Alaska ESP currently manages about 60 ongoing study projects, and maintains a multidisciplinary research program in physical oceanography, oil spill fate and effects, meteorology, biology and protected species, and social sciences. These include continuing studies in the Beaufort Sea and major new programs in the Chukchi Sea to supplement available information. Public input and partnerships with other agencies are an important aspect of the Alaska ESP. For example, each year the Annual Studies Plan is distributed for review to approximately 200 Federal, State and local governments; Native, environmental, industrial, and international organizations, as well as to our advisory group, the MMS Scientific Committee. Stakeholder comments are influential in managing the Program. MMS studies are often conducted in partnership with a wide variety of government, academic, and private institutions. These arrangements prominently include Inter-agency Agreements with the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, the USGS Biological Resources Division, and the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. Likewise, Cooperative Agreements through university based partnerships include the Coastal Marine Institute and the Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit, both anchored through the University of Alaska. MMS is a charter member of the Alaska Ocean Observing System and the North Slope Science Initiative.

u.s. Minerals Management Service

July 2009

The Minerals Management Service has an active program to fund and conduct Arctic oil spill research and development (R&D) projects. The Technology Assessment and Research Program (TAR) has engineering and oil spill technological components. Research includes study of oil spills that may occur on top of or underneath solid , stable ice, in broken ice, or in cold open waters . In most areas of the world , the greatest need is to develop operational tools to detect and map oil in any ice type and to develop effective response options to spilled oil in moving, broken pack ice . The R&D projects focus on remote sensing and surveillance, mechanical response , chemical treating agents including dispersants and in-situ burning. This research includes conducting operational research experiments with oil in sma"" and large test tanks, at sea and in ice conditions to demonstrate and improve oil spill response technologies and methodologies. The MMS is participating in opportunities to gain safety-related information in advance of future operations in the Arctic. Engineering properties and forces of moving ice on structures and pipelines are being studied. Moving sea ice includes forces exerted against offshore structures to the gouging of the seafloor (a factor to be considered in the placement of pipelines) . Engineering data for these hazards is important as operations move from exploration to production and as structures are considered for deeper water. Information on the Arctic research may be found at:
Coastal Impact Assistance Program

http://www.mms.gov/alaska/fo/INDEX.HTM

On September 30, 2008, MMS approved Alaska's Coastal Impact Assistance Program (ClAP) State Plan, making Alaska eligible to receive federal funds under the ClAP initiative. ClAP was established through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to promote coastal restoration by sharing with states and local communities a portion of revenues generated from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) resources. ClAP provides $250 million annually in the years 2007 through 2010 to the six oil and gas producing states. Alaska's portion was one percent of the national ClAP funds for 2007 and 2008. Alaska's portion increased in 2009 and 2010 due to the revenues generated from MMS's 2008 Chukchi Sea Sale 193, to a $37,471,876.48 for each year ($24,356,719 .71 directly to the State , and $13,115,156.77 directly to applicable local communities.) Grant applications for projects listed in the approved State plan are being submitted to MMS by both the State of Alaska and eligible coastal Boroughs. MMS expects to begin awarding grants for the eligible projects over the next few months. The current approved ClAP State Plan is scheduled to be amended to accommodate the new 2009-10 funding . The Alaska Division of Coastal and Ocean Management is in the process of soliCiting projects from eligible Coastal communities, State agencies and other applicants for inclusion in the new Plan . ClAP information may be found at: http://www.mms.gov/offshore/CIAPmain.htm

Resources are divided into two categories: Undiscovered, Technically Recoverable Resources (UTRR) are oil and gas pools that could be recovered using current technology without considering the cost or profit in producing them . Undiscovered, Economically Recoverable Resources (UERR) varies with oil and gas prices. Higher prices will support more exploration and production . Note: Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea models assume that oil is transported through TAPS and on to West Coast markets. Natural gas development is delayed until North Slope reserves are produced . The reported volumes are undiscovered at present. Large investments will be required to convert undiscovered, unproven resources to available reserves and future production.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY Washington. DC 20240

MAR -9 21m
The Honorable Dianne Feinstein Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies ?Committee on Appropriations United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Chairman Feinstein: This letter updates infonnation provided to you in a February 4, 2008, letter regarding oil and gas royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA) responding to your letter of April 18,2007, to former Secretary Kempthome. The infonnation below relates to the three items you requested. I. The current status of negotiations between the Department and the 45 companies holding 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds; a list which shows the companies that have agreed to renegotiate their leases; and the percent of the overall revenue loss that the Department attributes to each company. Currently, there are 43 companies that have record title or operating rights interest in the 1998 and 1999 offshore oil and gas leases that did not contain price thresholds. While we have had at least preliminary discussions with all companies that have held or currently hold significant interests, most companies appear to be waiting to see theoutcome of the Kerr-McGee litigation. This Administration will continue to work with Congress to reach an appropriate resolution of this issue. The Department reached agreements with six companies (Enclosure 1), and they have been paying royalties consistent with the terms of the agreements. Enclosure 2 provides an update on the amount and percentage, attributed to each company, of royalties that would have been paid through December 31, 2008, if price thresholds had applied to these leases. Please note that there are some differences between Enclosures 1 and 2 because the 43 companies listed in Enclosure 1 are current lessees of record title in the 1998 and 1999 leases, whereas, the companies listed in Enclosure 2 are companies with operating rights ownership in those 1998 and 1999 leases that have been or are currently in a producing status. Under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996, companies that are designated operators are primarily liable for royalty payments once leases are in producing status. 2. The current status of the Kerr-McGee legal challenge to the Department's authority to place price thresholds on any deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000; the anticipated resolution date for the case; and the Department's view on congressional legislation reaffirming the Department's authority to place price thresholds. On January 12, 2009, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion upholding the District Court and ruling in favor of Kerr-McGee. The Department of Justice is considering the Department's

2 recommendation that a motion be filed requesting the Fifth Circuit reconsider this ruling en

banco
3. The current status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been foregone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases, and estimates of future foregone royalties from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases and future royalties that may be at risk from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until these issues are resolved; and the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases until the Kerr-McGee suit is resolved. As requested, Enclosure 3 provides an update on the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties that have been forgone on the 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases as of December 31, 2008. Enclosure 4 outlines the status of the leases and the annual amount of royalties collected to date from the 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases. The annual amount of royalties increased from $1.1 billion in our February 4, 2008, letter to $1.5 billion to date. We will update these figures annually. Enclosure 5a provides a range of estimates, as of January 1,2009, for future royalties from 1996, 1997, and 2000 DWRRA leases that may be at risk due to the KerrMcGee litigation and Enclosure 5b provides estimates of future production and royalty value from 1998 and 1999 DWRRA leases. The estimates range from $18 billion to $19.0 billion and $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion in current year dollars, respectively. We will continue to send you updates as new infonnation becomes available. A copy of this letter is being sent to all Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Members. Should you or your staff have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by phone at (202) 208-6734.

Patty, the attached is a map depicting GOMESA. The yellow area within the blue outline of the ""Sale 181 Call Area"" were not subject to moratoria prior to enactment of GOMESA; the criteria for revenue sharing under this Act. If the EGOM were opened outside a 45 mile buffer, the yellow area inside the ""Sale 181 Call Area"" in the EGOM, would be subject to immediate revenue sharing. If the Destin Dome were to be open, the yellow area inside the ""Sale 181 Call Area"" ""Stovepipe"" would be subject to revenue sharing starting in FY 2017.

Many thanks again, and one more quick question: why does the federal share only decrease by 528 while the state share increases by 568 and LWCF increases by 188. shouldn't the federal decrease equal the total state and Iwcf increase? In any event, which is correct to use as the figure to deduct from our estimates of total potential royalties for all ocs resources in order to account for gomesa revenue sharing: 528 or 56+18= 748? thanks for your patience as I climb the learning curve. linda

Questions relating to the map of the areas in the Atlantic where seismic companies

have submitted permit requests. They would like to know: 1. The number of companies who have filed off of Massachusetts for permits Three 2. How many miles off MA shores 3. The company names that correspond with the colors on the map 4. Any detail we can provide on the permit applications, i.e. how far apart the seismic lines will be, how far off of Georges Bank for example
From 10 miles offshore Massachusetts to 200 mile EEZ (some lines beyond US EEZ) the following companies have proposed parts of their surveys offofMA: Spectrum lax 20 mile grid 17 ,000 miles offshore MA; 8600 miles offshore MA CGGVeritas 12.5 x 12.5 mile grid WestemGeco 2 x 10 mile grid 350 miles offshore MA

Attached above are individual maps for those companies with the individual state areas of responsibility. They may help show the extent in Massachusetts.
o There was a discussion on escalating rental rates in the various areas, we were asked to provide more exact figures. Please see attached PDFs on GOM and AK Rental Rates

o Request for the 4 major questions that were asked by the previous administration in the DPP. 1) Should there be buffer zones (i.e. areas where certain activities are prohibited or restricted)? If so, how large should they be? What criteria should be used for setting them (e.g., visual impacts, infrastructure, etc.)? Should they be uniform in all new areas or vary by area according to issues of concern andlor technical constraints? 2) Are there specific areas/subareas that should be excluded because they are particularly sensitive or because oil and gas activities may significantly conflict, in area, with other uses for which the areal subarea might be better suited (e.g., alternative energy)? 3) This Administration views revenue sharing as a strong feature of state participation in coastal resource development. When the President modified the presidential withdrawal, he called upon

Congress to address new legislation to enhance current revenue sharing laws, to allow broader state participation in fiscal planning related to future coastal resource development. Please provide your views on what policies and programs MMS, Congress and the Administration should consider relative to OCS revenue sharing. 4) For those areas proposed for leasing consideration in the Southern California Planning Area, in deciding the next steps in the 5-year program preparation, should MMS include a requirement for mandatory unitization to potentially limit the number of structures in one or more of these areas? o Information on the Winthrop Beach (Shores?) Restoration Project and use of Federal sand and gravel. MMS has heard about possibility of a Winthrop Beach project, but has never had a request for oes sand or serious discussions. The NOMES was a site initially considered for an expansion of Logan Airport, and later as aggregate for the Big Dig, but that was 10-12 years ago. MMS is not aware of any issues or discussions on sand with NMFS or the State on this.

Hi Lyn, It was interesting to that our briefing yesterday was for 2 members of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming (Morgan Gray and Jonathan Phillips), when I initiated the contact through staff for Rep Edward Markey (D-MA). This is all one in the same I suppose. Also on the line was a gentleman named Patrick? Phillip? from the Congressman's district who had a question on a beach nourishment issue. The briefing went well (nearly 1 hours I believe). Items we owe Morgan (I did not have a chance to follow up on any of these today, sorry).

o Chris showed them a map of the areas in the Atlantic where seismic companies have submitted permit requests. Brad should be familiar with this map. They would like to know: 1. The number of companies who have filed off of Massachusetts for permits Three 2. How many miles off MA shores 3. The company names that correspond with the colors on the map 4. Any detail we can provide on the permit applications, i.e. how far apart the seismic lines will be, how far off of Georges Bank for example From 10 miles offshore Massachusetts to 200 mile EEZ (some lines beyond US EEZ) the following companies have proposed parts of their surveys off of MA: miles offshore MA; lOx 20 mile grid Spectrum CGGVeritas 12.5 x 12.5 mile grid 8600 miles offshore MA 350 miles offshore MA WestemGeco 2 x 10 mile grid The individual maps for those companies with the individual state areas of responsibility are attached.

Hi Lyn,

It was interesting to that our briefing yesterday was for 2 members of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming (Morgan Gray and Jonathan Phillips), when I initiated the contact through staff for Rep Edward Markey (D-MA). This is all one in the same I suppose. Also on the line was a gentleman named Patrick? Phillip? from the Congressman's district who had a question on a beach nourishment issue. The briefing went well (nearly 1 %hours I believe) . Items we owe Morgan (I did not have a chance to follow up on any of these today, sorry). o Chris showed them a map of the areas in the Atlantic where seismic companies have submitted permit requests. Brad should be familiar with this map. They would like to know: 1. The number of companies who have filed off of Massachusetts for permits Three 2. How many miles off MA shores 3. The company names that correspond with the colors on the map 4. Any detail we can provide on the permit applications, i.e. how far apart the seismic lines will be, how far off of Georges Bank for example From 10 miles offshore Massachusetts to 200 mile EEZ (some lines beyond US EEZ) the following companies have proposed parts of their surveys offofMA: 17 ,000 miles offshore MA; Spectrum lOx 20 mile grid 8600 miles offshore MA CGGVeritas 12.5 x 12.5 mile grid WestemGeco 2 x 10 mile grid - 350 miles offshore MA The individual maps for those companies with the individual state areas of responsibility are attached. This may help show the extent in Massachusetts. o There was a discussion on escalating rental rates in the various areas. We said we would follow up with more exact figures.

We have received a request that will take some program coordination, time and elbow grease. We understand this request will take some time and require both 0 EMM and MRM to complete. Current tasks with set deadlines should not be delayed or set aside. However, we would like to get back to the committee early next week with an ETA - 2 weeks, a month, whatever is a reasonable expectation based on current workload. There is serious discussion on the House side about extending state territorial waters out to 12 miles. The idea would be that affected Federal leases would remain under Federal jurisdiction, but how the revenues will be treated is part of the discussions. We have been asked to provide, for each of the last 5 years (FY 04 through FY 08) the amount of revenues, presented by bonuses, rents, and royalties, from leases in Federal water from the state's current territorial seaward boundary out to 12 nautical miles from the coastline. We would suggest that it might be helpful to form a coordination team with OEMM and MRM COSs, program reps and OCA. Thank you,

Hi Lyn, There have been a few proposals to extend state territorial waters out to 12 miles across the board, and we're trying to get a sense of what the cost of that to the federal government would be. Could you let us know, for each of the last 5 years or so, the amount of royalties that have come from production from the federal/state boundary out to 12 miles? Thanks, --Steve

INTRODUCTION

With the passage of the Energy Policy Act of2005, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) acquired responsibilities for alternative energy activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Within the next 3-5 years, the MMS expects to receive applications for alternative energy projects that may include electricity generation from wind, wave or current technologies as outlined in the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, located on the internet at www.ocsenergy.anl.gov. All foreseeable alternative energy projects on the OCS will use undersea power cables to collect electricity that is generated offshore, transmit it into coastal areas, and connect it into an onshore power grid. A number of factors are important in determining the cable system of an offshore alternative energy project, including installation size (number of units), distance offshore, and the maximum power rating needed. Thus, different types of undersea power cables may be used according to the specific need and design of the project. All power cables emit electromagnetic fields (EMFs) to some degree. A typical EMF includes both electric and magnetic fields. Secondarily, an

induced electric field results when organisms move through the magnetic field. Since a number of marine species use natural electromagnetic fields for navigation, orientation, prey location, predator detection, or communication, concerns have been raised by various stakeholders regarding the potential impacts that undersea power cables may have to these sensitive marine speCIes. In order to conduct detailed environmental analyses of projects proposed for alternative energy development, the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the marine environment from EMFs must be evaluated in order for the MMS to make environmentally sound decisions about managing alternative energy activities and developing mitigation measures that avoid, minimize, rectify, eliminate, or compensate impacts. A fundamental first step requires an update of existing industry-based and ecological infonnation to assist in identifying data and knowledge gaps, and to frame future investigations. The first part of this study seeks to conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify the existing industry-based and ecological infonnation relevant to EMFs emitted by undersea power cables. ""Literature"" includes, but is not limited to, articles and papers published in journals; environmental analysis documents such as Environmental Impact Statements, Environmental Assessments, Environmental Impact Reports, Mitigated Negative Declarations, etc.; grey literature such as unpublished reports, web-based articles or reports, and expert testimony; and relevant media coverage. Once the information update is complete, the second part of this study seeks to integrate and synthesize the industry-based and ecological infonnation in order to assess potential impacts of alternative energy projects. The emphasis of this knowledge synthesis shall be on the potential direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts ofEMFs from alternative energy activities likely to occur on the OCS. Due to the importance of this synthesis as the foundation for future decisions, the products of this study will be subject to a peer review process.

C.2.

STUDY OBJECTIVES

The overarching goal of this study is to summarize and synthesize infonnation regarding the magnitude, duration, extent, and likelihood of

ecological impacts from EMFs emitted by undersea power cables potentially used by alternative energy projects on the OCS. The study products shall enable careful and timely environmental review of proposed projects that is useful to decision-makers and the public, and to effectively involve the public. Specific objectives are to: o Collect, review, and compile industry-based and spatial information on existing and proposed electric undersea power cable systems on the OCS that may expose electrosensitive and magneto sensitive species to electromagnetic fields. Since most, if not all, existing offshore alternative energy facilities are located in international waters, the Offeror is encouraged to include in the proposal a plan to incorporate relevant information from international sources. Industry-based and spatial information shall encompass the location of existing undersea power cables; the length, voltage, shielding, type of current (alternating or direct), and operating frequency of each cable; the estimated and/or directly measured frequency, duration, and spatial extent of electric and magnetic fields associated with each power cable; descriptions of mitigation measures used to avoid, minimize, rectifY, eliminate, or compensate electromagnetic field impacts (e.g. type of shielding, depth of cable burial) and the predicted or measured reduction in EMF associated with each mitigation measure; the determination and description of all mitigation monitoring activities conducted for any of these undersea power cables . o Collect, review and synthesize information on known electrosensitive and magneto sensitive marine species in the Alaska, Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Regions. The synthesis shall denote the type of sensory ability (electric, magnetic or both) and thresholds of sensitivity (if known); specifY the type of evidence used to determine electromagnetic sensitivity (e.g. morphological or histological evidence, behavioral and/or physiological demonstration of ability, etc.); identify which developmental stages may encounter EMFs from undersea power cables; indicate potential ecological consequences, if any, at both the individual and population levels for the electrosensitive and magneto sensitive species (e.g. attraction/repulsion; disruption of migration patterns, interference with prey location or communication, etc.) that encounter predicted ranges of electromagnetic

fields associated with undersea power cables potentially used in offshore alternative energy projects . o Review the applicability of past studies regarding EMF sensory ability of marine species in light of the technical range of EMFs generated by undersea power cables (both alternating and direct current) for the purpose of evaluating alternative energy projects. Propose future studies and suggest experimental designs to address information gaps regarding EMF impacts. For each of the Regions, identify species that are a priority for future investigations . o Synthesize information concerning EMF impacts and potential mitigations in a summary useful for environmental review of alternative energy projects. The summary shall include a discussion of the effectiveness of various EMF mitigation strategies; suggest other potential mitigation measures not presently used and identify the secondary environmental effects that might occur from implementation of the mitigation measures; and propose methods by which mitigation measures could be monitored.

INTRODUCTION

With the passage of the Energy Policy Act of2005, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) acquired responsibilities for alternative energy activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Within the next 3-5 years, the MMS expects to receive applications for alternative energy projects that may include electricity generation from wind, wave or current technologies as outlined in the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, located on the internet at www.ocsenergy.anl.gov. All foreseeable alternative energy projects on the OCS will use undersea power cables to collect electricity that is generated offshore, transmit it into coastal areas, and connect it into an onshore power grid. A number of factors are important in determining the cable system of an offshore alternative energy project, including installation size (number of units), distance offshore, and the maximum power rating needed. Thus, different types of undersea power cables may be used according to the specific need and design of the project. All power cables emit electromagnetic fields (EMFs) to some degree. A typical EMF includes both electric and magnetic fields. Secondarily, an induced electric field results when organisms move through the magnetic

field. Since a number of marine species use natural electromagnetic fields for navigation, orientation, prey location, predator detection, or communication, concerns have been raised by various stakeholders regarding the potential impacts that undersea power cables may have to these sensitive marine speCIes. In order to conduct detailed environmental analyses of projects proposed for alternative energy development, the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the marine environment from EMFs must be evaluated in order for the MMS to make environmentally sound decisions about managing alternative energy activities and developing mitigation measures that avoid, minimize, rectify, eliminate, or compensate impacts. A fundamental first step requires an update of existing industry-based and ecological information to assist in identifying data and knowledge gaps, and to frame future investigations. The first part of this study seeks to conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify the existing industry-based and ecological information relevant to EMFs emitted by undersea power cables. ""Literature"" includes, but is not limited to, articles and papers published in journals; environmental analysis documents such as Environmental Impact Statements, Environmental Assessments, Environmental Impact Reports, Mitigated Negative Declarations, etc.; grey literature such as unpublished reports, web-based articles or reports, and expert testimony; and relevant media coverage. Once the information update is complete, the second part of this study seeks to integrate and synthesize the industry-based and ecological information in order to assess potential impacts of alternative energy projects. The emphasis of this knowledge synthesis shall be on the potential direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts ofEMFs from alternative energy activities likely to occur on the oes. Due to the importance of this synthesis as the foundation for future decisions, the products of this study will be subject to a peer review process.

STUDY OBJECTIVES

The overarching goal of this study is to summarize and synthesize information regarding the magnitude, duration, extent, and likelihood of ecological impacts from EMFs emitted by undersea power cables potentially

used by alternative energy projects on the OCS. The study products shall enable careful and timely environmental review of proposed projects that is useful to decision-makers and the public, and to effectively involve the public. Specific objectives are to: o Collect, review, and compile industry-based and spatial information on existing and proposed electric undersea power cable systems on the OCS that may expose electrosensitive and magneto sensitive species to electromagnetic fields. Since most, if not all, existing offshore alternative energy facilities are located in international waters, the Offeror is encouraged to include in the proposal a plan to incorporate relevant information from international sources. Industry-based and spatial information shall encompass the location of existing undersea power cables; the length, voltage, shielding, type of current (alternating or direct), and operating frequency of each cable; the estimated and/or directly measured frequency, duration, and spatial extent of electric and magnetic fields associated with each power cable; descriptions of mitigation measures used to avoid, minimize, rectify, eliminate, or compensate electromagnetic field impacts (e.g. type of shielding, depth of cable burial) and the predicted or measured reduction in EMF associated with each mitigation measure; the determination and description of all mitigation monitoring activities conducted for any of these undersea power cables . o Collect, review and synthesize information on known electrosensitive and magneto sensitive marine species in the Alaska, Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Regions. The synthesis shall denote the type of sensory ability (electric, magnetic or both) and thresholds of sensitivity (if known); specify the type of evidence used to determine electromagnetic sensitivity (e.g. morphological or histological evidence, behavioral and/or physiological demonstration of ability, etc.); identify which developmental stages may encounter EMFs from undersea power cables; indicate potential ecological consequences, if any, at both the individual and population levels for the electrosensitive and magneto sensitive species (e.g. attraction/repulsion; disruption of migration patterns, interference with prey location or communication, etc.) that encounter predicted ranges of electromagnetic fields associated with undersea power cables potentially used in offshore

alternative energy projects . o Review the applicability of past studies regarding EMF sensory ability of marine species in light of the technical range ofEMFs generated by undersea power cables (both alternating and direct current) for the purpose of evaluating alternative energy projects. Propose future studies and suggest experimental designs to address infonnation gaps regarding EMF impacts. For each of the Regions, identify species that are a priority for future investigations . o Synthesize information concerning EMF impacts and potential mitigations in a summary useful for environmental review of alternative energy projects. The summary shall include a discussion of the effectiveness of various EMF mitigation strategies; suggest other potential mitigation measures not presently used and identify the secondary environmental effects that might occur from implementation of the mitigation measures; and propose methods by which mitigation measures could be monitored.

Linda, a complete analysis of potential revenues from all OCS areas would be a multi-month project. The best we can offer is to refer you to the revenue analysis/estimate developed for the OPP. The OPP issued in January 09 included an estimate of bonus bids and royalties to be generated from leases issued from the proposed lease sales. I have attached the full OPP for your information. The 2nd attachment provides Table A - the proposed schedule of lease sales, and Table B - estimate of leasing revenues and state shares from sales that might occur within the areas proposed for leasing. The individual Planning Area maps showing the OPP proposed areas are also attached as separate docs. From my review off S. 1333 The bill repeals GOMESA in its entirety; then establishes a similar revenue sharing program from leases issued as of January 1, 2000. However, the way I'm reading it, revenue sharing under S. 1330 appears to be limited to coastal states that did NOT have oil or gas production within 100 miles as of January 2000. This would eliminate revenue sharing (GOMESA and under S. 1330) to all GOM states, CA, and AK. Revenue sharing pretty much mirrors the GOMESA approach, 37.5% to states based on distance from revenue generating lease;; however, under GOMESA, 20% of funds to a State are allocated to political coastal subdivisions, under S. 1330, that amount is 40%. The annual cap for revenues to be shared under GOMESA is $500 million; however, as I read S. 1330, the $500 million annual cap is on the amount going to EACH state and its political coastal. Lyn

Subject: another revenue question
Hi Guys - Wondered if you'd taken a look at Sen. Barrasso's energy bill, S. 1333, introduced before the recess, and particularly Title III. I'm trying to do as accurate an estimate as possible of the loss to the federal treasury that would occur if this bill were enacted . As I read section 301 , it would provide states and local governments 37.5% of all receipts received in the fiscal year following the year of enactment from any leases entered into after 1/1 2000 up to an annual cap of $500 million in 2008 dollars. Is it possible to ballpark likely receipts from such leases if we assume this is enacted in 2009 and receipts start flowing to states in 2010? In our files I saw some estimates you all did a few years ago taking receipts out 50-60 years - are those still accurate? They may have assumed moratoria that are no longer in effect. What would you suggest is the most accurate way to estimate this? In the past to get an upper limit we've simply estimated amt of royalties available if all technically and/or economically recoverable resources were produced at the current royalty rate. There may be something more specific to the limitations of this bill that would be better. Or it may be accurate to assume that the $500 million cap will be applicable for the forseeable future since 37.5% of annual receipts seems to be consistently exceeding that number. Any estimates you have or could develop without significant pain would be much appreCiated. Not worth a lot of new analysis, but would appreciate your thoughts. Many thanks, as always. Linda

We have received a request that will take some program coordination, time and elbow grease. We understand this request will take some time and require both OEMM and MRM to complete. Current tasks with set deadlines should not be delayed or set aside. However, we would like to get back to the committee early next week with an ETA - 2 weeks, a month, whatever is a reasonable expectation based on current workload. There is serious discussion on the House side about extending state territorial waters out to 12 miles. The idea would be that affected Federal leases would remain under Federal jurisdiction, but how the revenues will be treated is part of the discussions. We have been asked to provide, for each of the last 5 years (FY 04 through FY 08) the amount of revenues, presented by bonuses, rents, and royalties, from leases in Federal water from the state's current territorial seaward boundary out to 12 nautical miles from the coastline. We would suggest that it might be helpful to form a coordination team with OEMM and MRM COSs, program reps and OCA.

Mrs. Chew, We apologize for the delay responding to the Congressman's request. While we hoped to provide you a definitive date for our response to the Congressman's letter, we find ourselves still working on the broader policy issues surrounding our compliance and regulatory responsibilities under the GOMESA. A congressman's letter receives careful consideration and this letter has raised the question of whether the appropriate role of Interior extends beyond the distribution of shared revenues. In particular, we are faced with the question of what is the nature of guidance that can be provided by the Interior Department when the Act does not include an Interior Department compliance responsibility. We have not yet received final advice from the Solicitor on Interior's legal standing if we offer GOMESA revenue sharing guidance beyond the distribution of revenues. However, as of today we have been promised that a response will be forthcoming by the Interior Solicitor by Tuesday, June 23rd . After receipt of the Solicitor's advice and edits to our draft response, our letter will enter the surnaming process and be reviewed by higher-level officials of the Department. Accordingly, it will likely take two to three weeks before we can send a final response. We will let you know if we have any further problems meeting this timeline.

Mrs. Chew, I'm writing to obtain clarification on the Congressman's question in the April 13, 2009 letter related to a State or Coastal Political Subdivision (CPS) using GOMESA funds to ""be used for debt relief of that particular [authorized] project."" We received a question from the State of Louisiana that was slightly different during the publication of the Proposed Rule (linked and excerpted below). The State of Louisiana requested that MMS disburse funds directly to the bondholder if requested by the State or CPS for an encumbered project. This is not a standard practice and MMS answered that we intend to disburse GOMESA funds to the State or CPS however a State or CPS is then free to adopt spending procedures involving trustees.
Final GOMESA Revenue Sharing Regulations: Page 78626: The State of Louisiana requested that States and their CPSs be allowed to designate a trustee to receive their annual GOMESA revenue allocations. Louisiana further states that assigning funds to a trustee would provide States and their CPSs a ""capability to maximize their ability to further the purposes of GOMESA by leveraging their payment streams into long-term financing instruments.""

The regulation remains silent on the designation of a funds trustee. The GOMESA specifically enumerates the four Gulf producing States, CPSs, and the LWCF as the recipients of GOMESA revenue sharing funds. It is MMS's standard practice to disburse revenue sharing funds to the Government entity to which the revenues are shared. Therefore, MMS intends to distribute GOMESA revenues to the designated State or CPS account in the name of State or CPS and not directly to a trustee. A State or CPS is then free to adopt spending procedures involving trustees.

I assume your constituents are asking if the State/CPS can use GOMESA revenue sharing funds to pay principal and interest to on a bond that was issued specifically for - or the proportional payment amount of the bond represents an authorized project's proportional share of the bond; and any bond payments would be made from the State or CPS receiving GOMESA funds? Thank you for any clarification you can provide. Sincerely, Marty Heinze MMS/OEMM/Economics Division 703-787-1010

Blythe, Brad J ""theodore boll@jec.senate.gov""; Herdt, Lyn; Haenny, Lesley; MMS 5YR Program Questions Monday, October 05,20094:31:00 PM

Mr. Boll, I apologize it took me so long to get this out to you today. I got swept up in a few ""fire-drills"" after we spoke and have just managed to get a few of them off of my plate. In regards to the time it takes to develop a 5 Year Program, generally speaking it takes 2 years from start to publication of the final Program. The fastest this has been accomplished in is 18months, but that was an extremely compressed and stressful timeline to meet. From the issuance of a lease to the first exploratory well will generally take 2-3 years. In an extremely well known and developed area, this can be accomplished faster (perhaps a year or so), but this is extremely rare, and they would almost have to be using existing infrastructure from an adjacent lease. From lease to first commercial production, this will generally occur within the lease primary term (5yrs in most cases). There are leases that come into production sooner (-2yrs), but they would be in similar situations as described above. For ""frontier areas"" (i.e. ultra-deep water) with no existing infrastructure or well developed knowledge of the geology, this process can take more than a decade. As you can see, there is a very large spread in these timeframes. The short timeframes assume there were no problems or delay with CZM consistency, NEPA, or other consultations (which may not be an accurate assumption). Please feel free to contact me with any further questions. I have CC'd Lyn Herdt and Lesley Haenny in our office of Congressional Affairs. They would serve as a great initial contact for other inquires as well. I hope this helps, Brad

To handle spills at drill sites located in this area, the lessee will be required to maintain 200 feet of sorbent boom and a means for deployment and disposal at the rig/platform site. The operator must be able to provide containment and cleanup capabilities both at the drill site and in the surrounding waters. (2) Based upon the results of the oil spill trajectory analysi? modeling, lessees conducting exploratory activities within these blocks will maintain nearshore oil spill cleanup and containment equipment at an approved oil spill equipment base. This equipment must be adequate for the protection of the coastal areas adjacent to these blocks and will be staged at onshore locations which will result in the operator being able to meet response times which are identified? based on the results of the oil spill trajectory analysis. Required equipment may include containment, swamp, and sorbent type booms and any other type of oil spill containment/cleanup equipment determined necessary to protect the coastal wetlands, estuaries (including oyster beds), and recreational beaches in the area. Actual reqvirements imposed by the Minerals Management Service (HHS) as to location, type, and size of onshore equipment for oil spill cleanup and ? contairuuent will be developed utilizing a plan developed specifically for this area and addressing the natural and economic resource values, location, and susceptibility of the area inCluding the Apalachicola Bay and Estuarine Sanctuary System. Such a plan will be developed by KMS in cOnjunction with the lessee and will be in place by November 1989. All exploration plans submitted for leases resulting from this sale shall adhere to the requirements outlined in this containment/cleanup plan.
(3) Lessees conducting exploratory activities will be required to maintain at an approved oil spill equipment base state-of-theart chemicals (dispersants) and chemical application equipment and have established plans approved by affected Federal Agencies, for their rapid application, if needed.

(Restriction on Exploration Activity) should carefully review paragraph 15 (Military Activities) of this Notice. 15. Military Activities. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) has three major air bases in Florida that use most of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico for reaearch, development, testing, and evaluation of advanced tactical air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons systems. These air bases are Eglin Air Force Base, Tyndall Air Force Base, and HcDi11 Air Force Base. The only Air Force test location larqe enough to meet the requirements of these bases is the eastern gulf. The types of missions conducted by the USAF involve flying from extremely high altitudes to very lov altitudes at very high speeds. Safe and effective testing of most of these systems can be performed only OVer larqe expanses of water, subject to surveillance and monitoring control by strategically ? located land/water/airborne tracking facilities. ? The intrinsic danger to the oil industry offshore is the occurrence of falling debris as drone planes are shot down or exploded, dropping of ordnance, low-flying planes, and offshore-to-onshore and vice versa testing of Weapons and tactical testing missions. Threats to life and property could exist if proper precautionary measures are not undertaken for OCS structures and operations in the area. ' Therefore, a. stipulation (stipulation No.5) which will restrict the. timing ?and location of exploration activities will be included in any leases shown on Hap 1 within Kilitary ?Warning Areas W'""151, and 4. There is conoern over the W-168, W-470, and EWTA I, 2, military restrictions imposed on leasee in the eastern qulf, particularly with regard to the delays .involved in operating on leases outside of areas made available for drilling following Lease Sale 94 (December ' 18, 19.8 5), the most recent safe ill . the eastern gulf. As .. consequence of this concern, a bid? for any bloc, shown k or Hap I within Military Warning Areas W-151, W-16?8,. W-470, and 1. 2, 3, and 4 will be subject to different procedures from ttose otherwise identified in this Notice. lifter the HHS cOlllpletes. its bid adequacy review, it will bidders of the results of ?this review. If a high bid is?determined to be inadequate, it will be ? rejected, and the bidder's deposit will be returned ? with interest, as prescribed in 30 CFR 21B.155. If a bid is determined to be adequate, the bidder wili be so notified and will be required to furnish a corporate surety bond in a sum equal? to the balance of the cash bonus bid, directed by the authorized ottice?r. HOve'Yer, this notification and requirement will constitute acceptance of the bid. Upon filing the surety bond as directed, the bidder is liable tor payment of the fourfifths bonus unless the bid is subsequently rejected. No bid will be accepted until the united States determines t .h at it is in its best interest? to do so.
21

When the removal of the restriction on the initiation of exploration activities on a block or area occurs, it will be considered to be in the best interests of the United States to accept a bid for a lease on that particular block. At such time, the authorized officer will promptly accept the high bid submitted on the block and require the bidder to execute the lease, submit the remaining four-fifths bonus and the first year's rental by EFT, and file a bond a. prescribed in 30 CFR 256.47(f). Failure to pay the s remaining four-fifths bonus in a timely manner will be deemed to render the bidder in default of the bid payment, enabling the United States to obtain payment of the outstanding bonus from the bidder's surety. The four-fifths bonus and the first year's rental must be paid by EFT using the procedure described in paragraph 10 of this Notice. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York must receive the EFT payment no later than noon, Eastern Standard Time, on the 11th bUsiness day after receipt of the notice of bid acceptance. The term .""business day"" is defined as a day on which the Gulf of Mexico regional office is open for business. At such time as the united States may determine that it would not be in its best interests to accept a bid, the MMS shall reject such bid for a lease within the above-re?f erenced Hil.itary Warning Areas and EWTA and refund the bid deposit with interest. in accordance with 30 CFR 218.155. In any event, if the authorized officer does not accept the bid within 5 years after the .date of the lease sale. the MHS shall? reject such bid and return the bid deposit to the bidder with ?actual intere? t .earned. s Authority for the ? procedures in this paragraph is in 30 CFR 218.155, 256.46(b). 256.47(e) (2), 256.58(9) (2), and 256.59. 16 o .. New Regulatory Provisions. The regulatory reference to provisions in 30 CFR Part 250 cited in this ?document refer to the new HHS ""Oil and Gas and Sulphur operations in ? the Outer Continental Shelf."" They were pilblished in the Federal Register at 53 FR 10595 on April I, 1988. This Notice is provided to bidders since any leases issued as a result of this sale viII be subject to the April I, 1988, regulations (not those existing in the 30 CFR Part 250. revised as of 3uly 1. 19B7, which may be in conflict. with the neW regulM,ions).

Hi - many thanks to all of you and please pass along to whoever else worked so quickly to get us info for yesterday's markup. It was enormously helpful. I'm sure I'll be bothering you again as we move toward final passage thru committee. And in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, I wonder if I could bother someone in the next couple weeks to do a ocs 101 briefing for me - it's been a while since ive done these issues, and some basic background on the legal requirements as well as the planning areas and status of that work would be very helpful in getting back up to speed.

No huge rush and know you all are busy, so let me know what a convenient time might be for whoever is the right person or persons. Many thanks again --- much appreciated. Linda

Mr. Ferguson, My apologies, the morning of the 26 th has filled up rather quickly today. This Friday at 10AM has also been reserved on his schedule. As I am sure you can appreciate, requests for briefings have been coming quickly with all of the current energy legislation being discussed. Would 3:30pm on the 26th work for you and Mr. Jerman? If not, perhaps between 9:30 and 11 :OOAM on Monday the 29th ? Again, My apologies for the difficulty in scheduling. -Brad

Thanks very much, Lyn .

I have gotten some other press-release-type announcements from MMS in the meantime, such as Lesley sending me the notice of the $1 million grant award to the Smithsonian on May 19th , but that's not on your newsroom page.

Hi Lyn, I just saw the story in Greenwire about MMS issuing a new proposed rule on a Safety and Environmental Management System, and I'd like to get someone in here to brief me on what the rule is all about. In addition, I feel like we're getting more and more notice of MMS issues from Greenwire (or other outside sources) than from MMS itself - is there a way to make sure that we get more info directly from MMS before things get sent to the Federal Register? Also, I've noticed that we haven't gotten any MMS press releases emailed to us since the beginning of May. Can you also make sure that we get those as they come out?

In addition, I feel like we're getting more and more notice of MMS issues from Greenwire (or other outside sources) than from MMS itself - is there a way to make sure that we get more info directly from MMS before things get sent to the Federal Register? Also, I've noticed that we haven't gotten any MMS press releases emailed to us since the beginning of May. Can you also make sure that we get those as they come out? Thanks, --Steve

Thanks very much, Lyn. In checking the MMS Newsroom page though, which I admit I should be doing more often , I see three press releases, only one of which has to do with the renewable energy workshops, and then there are seven releases in May, none of which I can find any record of receiving. I have gotten some other press-release-type announcements from MMS in the meantime, such as Lesley sending me the notice of the $1 million grant award to the Smithsonian on May 19th , but that's not on your newsroom page. We certainly appreciate getting the extra notice for items that don't appear on the website, but we'd also like to make sure that we get everything that does go on the website. Thanks again, --Steve

We have had only 2 releases in June having to do with renewable energy workshops, but I will check to make sure all is well with our distribution list. I will ask Brad to set a meeting with you to discuss the proposed rule. If everything was just short of perfect, we would be in a position to notify you ahead on these FR publications. I will make the effort to see what we can do to move in that direction. Lyn

We have had only 2 releases in June having to do with renewable energy workshops, but I will check to make sure all is well with our distribution list.
I will ask Brad to set a meeting with you to discuss the proposed

rule.

If everything was just short of perfect, we would be in a position to notify you ahead on these FR publications. I will make the effort to see what we can do to move in that direction. Lyn

Hi Lyn, I just saw the story in Greenwire about MMS issuing a new proposed rule on a Safety and Environmental Management System, and I'd like to get someone in here to brief me on what the rule is all about. In addition, I feel like we're getting more and more notice of MMS issues from Greenwire (or other outside sources) than from MMS itself - is there a way to make sure that we get more info directly from MMS before things get sent to the Federal Register? Also, I've noticed that we haven't gotten any MMS press releases emailed to us since the beginning of May. Can you also make sure that we get those as they come out? Thanks, --Steve

The new politicals at 001 and DOD are tweaking it slightly, but as you know every change requires new approvals, It should be out soon, As Chris said, it is primarily an update to reflect MMS's new authority for renewable energy on the OCS , -Brad

Hi - many thanks to all of you and please pass along to whoever else worked so quickly to get us info for yesterday's markup. It was enormously helpful. I'm sure I'll be bothering you again as we move toward final passage thru committee. And in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, I wonder if I could bother someone in the next couple weeks to do a ocs 101 briefing for me - it's been a while since ive done these issues, and some basic background on the legal requirements as well as the planning areas and status of that work would be very helpful in getting back up to speed. No huge rush and know you all are busy, so let me know what a convenient time might be for whoever is the right person or persons. Many thanks again --- much appreciated. Linda

Hi - many thanks to all of you and please pass along to whoever else worked so quickly to get us info for yesterday's markup. It was enormously helpful. I'm sure I'll be bothering you again as we move toward final passage thru committee. And in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, I wonder if I could bother someone in the next couple weeks to do a oes 101 briefing for me - it's been a while since ive done these issues, and some basic background on the legal requirements as well as the planning areas and status of that work would be very helpful in getting back up to speed. No huge rush and know you all are busy, so let me know what a convenient time might be for whoever is the right person or persons. Many thanks again --- much appreciated. Linda

I don't anticipate anything that would keep us from meeting on the 20th (barring MMS staff scheduling issues). I will keep you updated. Thanks, Brad

Monica, My apologies for not remembering this while we were on the phone. Due to the nature of this request, I have included MMS' statement on inquiries into the Atlantis Platform.

The Minerals Management Service received a copy of a letter from a special interest group to the Department of the Interior requesting an investigation into British Petroleum's Atlantis platform, which is operating in the Gulf of Mexico. MMS is currently reviewing the contents of the letter. As a matter of policy, however, we do not publicly discuss whether investigations are ongoing or pending in order to maintain the integrity of the investigation process. I realize this probably isn't very helpful at the moment, but this is all we are allowed to say for now. -Brad

Lesley, Just so I have this straight, I am to tell my boss that MMS has nothing to say about this Atlantis business other than they received a letter from a group raising safety concerns about a BP oil platform and that MMS will be reviewing the letter for some indeterminant period of time?

Lesley, Thank you for getting back to me. I am really just looking for information about the claims being made by this group. If there was a serious problem with Atlantis, I assume that there would be some mention of it somewhere in the press, but the only information available on the web is from the group (Food and Water Watch) that is making the accusation, which seems a little fishy. Without getting into specifics about whether or not MMS is conducting an investigation, can you provide me with information on whether there are any permit or documentation problems with Atlantis? As you probably know, the group claims that engineering certifications for the project are lacking.

Stratton, Sorry this took a little bit. I wanted to be sure we had everything you were looking for. The response below comes from our staff in the Gulf Region. Let me know if we can get you anything else. -Brad

Repairs will be made by Shell Pipeline Company LP. Repairs most likely will require cutting the section of pipeline with the crack and replacement with a new section of pipeline in area of damage. Production will necessarily remain shut-in during these repairs. The oil spill was managed by US Coast Guard under a Unified Command consisting of members from Shell, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, with support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.Sm Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Coast Guard Capt. Joseph Paradis, federal on-scene commander for the Unified Command, indicated that he was ""pleased by the close cooperation shown by all of the organizations involved in the response."" The Eugene Island Pipeline system will be restarted following repairs and a thorough inspection. Top priorities during the response and restart phases are safety and the protection of the environment.

MMS will accept/concur with the repair plan and review the repairs of all OCS pipelines under the provisions of the applicable ROW grant.

MMS will not grant final approval of repairs to Shell Pipeline Company's Eugene Island pipeline since the pipeline is under the authority of the US .. @f TransporiatiOli1m MMS is notified of the repair completion and will receive of copy of the report on final pipeline repairs. MMS is also notified when the operator returns to production. MMS inspectors can inspect facilities and observe the potential for oil sheens from helicopters while transiting to and from regular inspections in the Gulf of Mexico.

Importance: High Linda Lance has requested MMS assistance with a couple estimates of OCS revenues and States' share under two scenarios involving the entire OCS: 1) development of all technically recoverable resources and 2) development of all economically recoverable resources. She provides below specific assumptions regarding royalty rate, percentage of States' share, and in the second scenario, prices of $70 barrel/$4/Tcf for oil and gas (she did not specify commodity prices for the first scenario; I have sent her a message to ask if she wants us to use the same prices as in the 2 nd scenario). She does write that she is hoping we can get this to her in the next couple days. I responded that I doubted this was possible, but I would get back with her later today with a possible ETA. Chris and Vicki, would we be able to talk with Marshall and his group sometime this morning to get a sense of how these estimates could be done and in what realistic timeframe given other work priorities?

Here are the parameters we're interested in: 1. Calculation of the state share of OCS receipts if we assume o 37.5% state revenue sharing o Development of all technically recoverable oil and gas resources on the entire OCS o Royalty rate of 18.75% o Deduct revenue that would be available to states under current law (GOMESA) (materials I have from MMS this summer indicate GOMESA is 56 billion between 2007-2067 - is that right?) 2. Calculation of the state share of OCS receipts assuming: o 37.5% state revenue sharing o Development of all economically recoverable OCS resources assuming oil at $70/barrel and natural gas at $4/Tcf o Royalty rate of 18.75% o Deduct revenue that would be available to states under current law (GOMESA) Hope this won't be too onerous. Would love to have in next couple days. Please write or call with any questions or problems - 224-7556. Many thanks as always

Subject: Request for estimates if all OCS resource estimates were produced

Linda: Marshall's group finished up the estimate in response to our phone conversation last week. a look at the attached Excel sheet; notice there are 6 separate sheets.

Please take

Marshall offers the following explanation of the work: We interpreted this request as asking for an estimate of the revenue shares that would be forthcoming to the States under new legislation that is similar to the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The main difference from GOMESA would be that the revenue shares would not be capped at $500 million per year, and of course, revenues from the central and western Gulf of Mexico planning areas would not be included since they are already included under GOMESA. Our analysis includes three planning areas from the Atlantic region, two in the eastern port of the Gulf of Mexico, four in the Pacific, and five in Alaska . We've also conducted an analysis of GOMESA revenue sharing projections in the western and central Gulf of Mexico and included those results as well. The tables from which the discussion below has been developed are included in the Attachment above. Based on a combination of historical experience and previous modeling results, we distributed both the undiscovered economically recoverable resources (UERR) and the undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR) as currently estimated by MMS, for each of the 14 planning areas (outside the western and central Gulf of Mexico), over sales held from 5 consecutive 5-year programs beginning in 2012. We then developed streams of production emerging from each sale in each planning area, and summed those results to obtain annual flows of oil and gas production. We the incorporated the oil and gas price assumptions provided in the request below, expressed in both in real and nominal terms, and obtained the annual aggregate gross value of production on the entire OCS absent the central and western Gulf of Mexico. The royalties per year were computed from the gross value measures by netting out the transportation costs to obtain gross value at the wellhead, and then multiplying this measure by the applicable royalty rate decimal: 0.1875 outside of Alaska, and 0.125 in Alaska planning areas. (Note that the transportation costs are much higher in Alaska especially for gas.) The bonus estimates for each sale were made based on appropriately specified planning area specific fractions of the aggregate value of the flows of production, based on past modeling findings. In addition to bonuses and royalties, rentals are also shared under GOMESA. However, the Interior Department's Appropriations language precludes any sharing of the portion of rentals above a base level of $3 per acre per year. Also, the full amount of rentals ordinarily collected by MMS is only a small percentage of aggregate leasing revenues. Finally, estimating rentals depends upon the number of tracts leased and how long those tracts remain active, which involves a different calculation procedure than we used here for bonuses and royalties, whose measures depend on resource value. For these reasons we chose to omit the sharing of rentals from this task. The sequence of five 5-year programs beginning in mid-2012 as we modeled them involves a series of lease sales held through the middle of 2038. We chose the to count production and cash flows resulting from these sales through year 2055 for the present task. During the period 2012-2055, in these 14 planning areas, we estimated that production of the UERR would consist of 16 billion barrels of oil and 41 trillion cubic feet of gas. The sum of bonuses and royalties is expected to be $229 billion in real, 2012 dollars and $376 billion in current dollars assuming a 2% inflation rate. Revenue sharing for the States and their coastal political subdivisions would amount to $86 billion in real dollars and $141 billion in nominal dollars. In the case where antiCipated and actual production is represented by the UTRR, we would expect the extraction of 44 billion barrels of oil and 203 trillion cubic feet of gas, with most of the increase over the UERR coming from Alaska planning areas such as the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea. During the same 2012-2055 period, these UTRR amounts would generate a sum of bonuses and royalties equal to $532 billion in real dollars and $858

billion in nominal dollars. The associated revenue sharing amounts to the States is estimated to be $199 billion in real dollars and $322 billion in nominal dollars. Note that the increase in revenue sharing under the UTRR compared to the UERR is proportionally less than it is for the resource amounts. This is the case because the increased resources under the UTRR, mostly in Alaska, are valued less than the underlying resources in other planning areas. In contrast to these estimates, our current projection for GOMESA revenue sharing over the same 2012-2055 period is only $20 billion in nominal dollars. The main difference from an earlier estimate of $56 billion is primarily that this previous estimate was made over a longer time period, and those few extra years distort the results because the cap on GOMESA revenue sharing expires after 2055. Thus, a disproportionate part of that previous $56 billion dollar estimate actually occurs in the last 12 years or so of the period being analyzed. Thanks, Marshall Rose

Subject: RE: Request for estimates if all OCS resource estimates were produced
Hi - many thanks again for this good work. I had just a few questions, and maybe easiest to get on the phone with marshall tomorrow if possible. I'll set them out below and you/he can let me know if having a conversation would be helpful.

1. I was struck by how dramatically the GOMESA estimate of revenue sharing was affected by ending the
estimates at 2055 - in part I understand by the fact that the annual cap on revenues of $500 million/year ends in 2055. but that must still mean that the expectation is that there will be Significant production and revenue generated after 2055 . what we're looking for in the estimate is the likely revenue over the life of each resource . Your spreadsheet seems to indicate that about an additional $17 billion would go to states if we take it out to 2070 under your UTRR scenario - $338 billion total, $150 billion in the UERR scenario. Am I reading that correctly? Any reason not to do that? 2. Since the Secretary is considering raising royalty rates, it'd be interesting to have data if royalties for all planning areas were the same - 18.75%. is it difficult to run this calculation assuming that alaska royalties were the same as rest of country just for comparison? 3. eia most recent forecasts show increases in gas and oil prices from the assumptions used for pricing: e.g., to $81 barrel by end of 2010 ; to 5.37/MMbtu for rest of 2010. did you use any inflation factor or other assumptions to reflect price increases in product over the decades? Thanks again - happy to discuss. Would like to resolve these questions by tomorrow if at all possible. Really appreciate your help. thx

Linda: Marshall's group finished up the estimate in response to our phone conversation last week. a look at the attached Excel sheet; notice there are 6 separate sheets.

Please take

Marshall offers the following explanation of the work: We interpreted this request as asking for an estimate of the revenue shares that would be forthcoming to the States under new legislation that is similar to the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The main difference from GOMESA would be that the revenue shares would not be capped at $500 million per year, and of course, revenues from the central and western Gulf of Mexico planning areas would not be included since they are already included under GOMESA. Our analysis includes three planning areas from the Atlantic region, two in the eastern port of the Gulf of Mexico, four in the Pacific, and five in Alaska. We've also conducted an analysis of GOMESA revenue sharing projections in the western and central Gulf of Mexico and included those results as well. The tables from which the discussion below has been developed are included in the Attachment above. Based on a combination of historical experience and previous modeling results, we distributed both the undiscovered economically recoverable resources (UERR) and the undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR) as currently estimated by MMS, for each of the 14 planning areas (outSide the western and

central Gulf of Mexico), over sales held from 5 consecutive 5-year programs beginning in 2012. We then developed streams of production emerging from each sale in each planning area, and summed those results to obtain annual flows of oil and gas production . We the incorporated the oil and gas price assumptions provided in the request below, expressed in both in real and nominal terms, and obtained the annual aggregate gross value of production on the entire OCS absent the central and western Gulf of Mexico. The royalties per year were computed from the gross value measures by netting out the transportation costs to obtain gross value at the wellhead, and then multiplying this measure by the applicable royalty rate decimal: 0.1875 outside of Alaska, and 0.125 in Alaska planning areas. (Note that the transportation costs are much higher in Alaska especially for gas.) The bonus estimates for each sale were made based on appropriately specified planning area specific fractions of the aggregate value of the flows of production, based on past modelil',lg findings. In addition to bonuses and royalties, rentals are also shared under GOMESA. However, the Interior Department's Appropriations language precludes any sharing of the portion of rentals above a base level of $3 per acre per year. Also, the full amount of rentals ordinarily collected by MMS is only a small percentage of aggregate leasing revenues. Finally, estimating rentals depends upon the number of tracts leased and how long those tracts remain active, which involves a different calculation procedure than we used here for bonuses and royalties, whose measures depend on resource value. For these reasons we chose to omit the sharing of rentals from this task. The sequence of five 5-year programs beginning in mid-2012 as we modeled them involves a series of lease sales held through the middle of 2038 . We chose the to count production and cash flows resulting from these sales through year 2055 for the present task. During the period 2012-2055, in these 14 planning areas, we estimated that production of the UERR would consist of 16 billion barrels of oil and 41 trillion cubic feet of gas. The sum of bonuses and royalties is expected to be $229 billion in real , 2012 dollars and $376 billion in current dollars assuming a 2% inflation rate. Revenue sharing for the States and their coastal political subdivisions would amount to $86 billion in real dollars and $141 billion in nominal dollars. In the case where anticipated and actual production is represented by the UTRR, we would expect the extraction of 44 billion barrels of oil and 203 trillion cubic feet of gas, with most of the increase over the UERR coming from Alaska planning areas such as the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea. During the same 2012-2055 period, these UTRR amounts would generate a sum of bonuses and royalties equal to $532 billion in real dollars and $858 billion in nominal dollars. The associated revenue sharing amounts to the States is estimated to be $199 billion in real dollars and $322 billion in nominal dollars. Note that the increase in revenue sharing under the UTRR compared to the UERR is proportionally less than it is for the resource amounts. This is the case because the increased resources under the UTRR, mostly in Alaska, are valued less than the underlying resources in other planning areas. In contrast to these estimates , our current projection for GOMESA revenue sharing over the same 2012-2055 period is only $20 billion in nominal dollars. The main difference from an earlier estimate of $56 billion is primarily that this previous estimate was made over a longer time period, and those few extra years distort the results because the cap on GOMESA revenue sharing expires after 2055. Thus, a disproportionate part of that previous $56 billion dollar estimate actually occurs in the last 12 years or so of the period being analyzed. Thanks, Marshall Rose

Washington, D.C. 20071 REF: MMS-2010-00243 Dear Mr. Stephens, This is in response to your Freedom ofInformation Act (FOrA) request dated June 2, 2010 and received in this office on June 3, 2010. In your request, you sought ""correspondence since January 1,2004, between the Minerals Management Service (now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE)) and members of Congress and their staff members, and all correspondence between the Minerals Management Service (BOEMRE) and Congressional committees and their staff members."" We are writing you today to provide you with a partial response. Enclosed are approximately 1,553 pages of documents responsive to your request. Several pages have been partially redacted citing the following exemptions:

Exemption 2 of the FOIA (5 U.S.c. ? 552 (b)(2)) Exemption 6 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. ? 552 (b)(6)) Exemption 2:
Exemption 2 protects from public disclosure records that are related to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. It includes two distinct categories of records: ""Low 2"" is dealing with internal matters of a relatively trivial nature for which there is no legitimate public interest or benefit; and is applicable when it would impose an administrative burden on the agency to process and release the requested records. ""High 2"" is more substantive, the disclosure of which would allow circumvention of a statute or agency regulation. The premise under ""high 2"" is that disclosure would not benefit those attempting to violate the law and avoid detection. We have determined that fixed conference call codes belong to the category of information likely to result in harmful circumvention under ""high 2.""

Exemption 6:

2

Personal cellular telephone numbers; personal email addresses; residential addresses; residential telephone numbers: When disclosure of information about a particular individual is requested, we must detennine whether release of the information would constitute a clearly ""unwarranted"" invasion of the individual ' s privacy. NARA v. Favish, 124 S. Ct. 1570, 1580 (2004) . To make this determination, we are required to perform a ""balancing test."" This means we must weigh the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to disclosure.
(1)

(2)

(3)

First, we must determine whether the individual has a discernable privacy interest in the information that has been requested. Next, we must detennine whether release of this information would serve ""the public interest generally"" (i.e., whether it would ""shed light on the performance of the agency 's statutory duties""). Finally, we must determine whether the public interest in disclosure is greater than the privacy interest of the individual in withholding.

The information that we are withholding consists solely of the above category of infonnation and was determined that the individuals to whom this information pertains have a substantial privacy interest in it. Additionally, we have determined that the disclosure of this information would shed little or no light on the performance of the agency's statutory duties and that the public interest to be served by its disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals in question, in withholding it. Nat' I Ass'n of Retired Fed. Employees v. Homer, 879 F.2d 873, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Mr. Timothy Baker with the Office of the Solicitor was consulted in reaching these decisions.
